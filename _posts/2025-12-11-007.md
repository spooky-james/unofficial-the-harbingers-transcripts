NARRATOR: Sinclair University, Adam Blackwell’s Office. April, 2028. 

##### [A DOOR OPENS AND SOMEONE ENTERS]

##### [ADAM FLIPS THROUGH A PACKET OF NOTES AS HE SPEAKS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Trevor, thanks for coming in. Look, I appreciate all the work that you’ve been putting into translating the stuff they’ve been digging up in Atacama, but... I don’t know, it sort of feels like we’re missing something. Something big and obvious that’s starting us right in the... 

##### [WHOEVER JUST ENTERED THE OFFICE CLEARS THEIR THROAT]

...face. Umm, hello? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Hello, Dr. Blackwell. The two of us need to talk. 

##### [OPENING THEME MUSIC BEGINS]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

We’re coming up on a few of the big turning points now... Walker. The Hearts and Minds Tour. The Doomscroller. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Please tell me you don’t need me to talk about the Doomscroller. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Not a fan? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No. He’s an egotistical anarchist, wildly irresponsible, an active danger as far as I’m concerned, and - oh yes, little thing - he called himself the fucking Doomscroller.  

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

_[holding back laughter]_ It is a little on the theatrical side- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Do you have any idea how many times I’ve had to say the words “The Doomscroller” out loud? When talking to important people? When talking at the U.N.? I’m thirty-two and I’ve had to give my opinion on things The Doomscroller is doing with a straight fucking face. Fucking ridiculous. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Yes, very good, if we could perhaps move onto - ?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

The day I figure out how that jackass got magic... 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

If we could move on, please... I’d like to talk about April Fourth, 2028. 

##### [A LONG, STARTLED PAUSE] 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

... or do you wanna talk about the Doomscroller instead?

##### [ADAM LETS OUT A LOW, ANNOTED GROAN]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Thank you. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Thank you for what? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Before you came in today, Erica and I made a little bet. She thought you’d be quite excited to talk about the day in question, I thought you might be rather... you at the prospect. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Ha-ha.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Now, while I’m sure there’s going to be an absolutely absurd answer to this question... whence the hesitance? Why do you not want to talk about what happened? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Because... what happened was a mistake. Like you said, this is a before and an after moment. And I knew it - I knew it was a bad idea. And I still... yeah. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Why don’t you start at the beginning? 

##### [ADAM TAKES A DEEP BREATH]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It started... with a knock on the door to my office.

#### NARRATOR

Sinclair University. April Fourth, 2028. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

The two of us need to talk. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

O-okay? Umm, have a seat, I guess. 

##### [SHE SITS DOWN AS SHE SPEAKS]

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Thank you. Dr. Blackwell, I - actually, wait, do you know who I am? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL: You’re Andrea Shepherd. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Yes, good. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You’re Andrea Shepherd and you’re in my office right now. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Terrific.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You’re Andrea Shepherd, why are you in my office? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Okay, shut up. I’m in your office because I need your help, professor. I need a magician. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Uh-uh. That is- 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Let me finish-

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, no, no- 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

–explaining what the- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL: 

I don’t think it would- 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

—situation is before you- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It’s not the sort - 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

—it’s a matter of life and death!

##### [A PAUSE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...what are you talking about? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Okay. I assume you’ve heard the news? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...not ...particularly. What news? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

The news out of Japan, Dr. Blackwell. Kris Middendorf just had a massive heart attack. 

##### [A DRAMATIC MUSIC STING WHICH ABRUPTLY CUTS OFF AS ADAM SPEAKS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Who the fuck is Kris Middendorf? 

##### [TRANSITION WOOSH]


------


#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Are you for goddamn real right now? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, wait- 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

You are seriously going to tell me- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

In my defense- 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

-that you had never heard of Kris Middendorf before - ?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I’d never been much of a movie person and I’d been a little busy with- 


#### CLAUDIA SKINNER (SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE BELOW)

I mean, this isn’t just some actor from a couple of indie movies, by 2028 he was huge! He’d been in that iPhone commercial that was everywhere, he was the bad guy in Reign of Terror, did you not see Reign of Terror? Everyone loved him, he was on magazine covers, and he was the good lawyer in that courtroom drama that swept at the - I mean seriously, I understand that you were busy, but come on. The man was everywhere, he’d been nominated for an Oscar two months ago and you’re really going to sit here and tell me you’d never heard of him before April Fourth, 2028?!

#### ADAM BLACKWELL (SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE ABOVE)

—the whole “trying to resurrect a dead language so I can actually do magic,” thing? You know, because that’s the sort of thing that takes a little while, okay? So you’ll pardon me if I fell a little behind on - no, I didn’t see Reign of Terror, everyone told me it was great, I meant to see it, but then there was a new translation - of course you’d say that, a movie with a good lawyer in it? And you liked it? What a shocking turn. Well, while you were watching your little courtroom drama, I was busy doing work, so, no, I’d never heard of him before April Fourth, 2028!

##### [A PAUSE]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

For the record... in 2028, Kris Middendorf was America’s new actor boyfriend. He was smart, beautiful, and talented. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yes. I know that. Now. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Good. And also for the record, the correct answer to the question, “Did you know who Kris Middendorf was?” - you know the kind a mammal would give, not some kind of weird academic pod person - is, “Yes, of course I knew who Kris Middendorf was.” 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I would get to know plenty about Kris Middendorf. In due time. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

...yes, I suppose that’s true. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay. Well then. Can I get to the heart of the matter? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Please.

#### NARRATOR

Sinclair University Hospital. Thirty minutes later. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, I don’t understand. Who has a heart attack at thirty-three? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

I’m sure that Mr. Middendorf will be very interested in delving deeper into that matter if he lives through today. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And a _massive_ heart attack at that? What makes a heart attack “massive?” Are doctors even allowed to talk about medical episodes that way? 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Blood vessels. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

It depends on the blood vessel that’s blocked. Not all veins and arteries are made equal. If the blockage occurs in one of the smaller arteries, that only supplies a part of the heart with blood... they call that a mild heart attack. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And that’s not bad? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Well, it’s still a goddamn heart attack, so I’m guessing it’s pretty bad. But if you have to have a heart attack... 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...that’s the kind you want to have. Sure. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

But when what gets blocked is one of the major arteries, it leads to a rapid shutdown of all cardiovascular activity. Or what is technically called... 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...a massive heart attack, sure. And this guy had one in Japan? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

On the island of Hokkaido, actually. He was there for a film shoot. Cypher Rose Two. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Who the hell is Cypher Rose and why was she also there?

##### [A PAUSE, ANDREA LETS OUT A LOW BREATH]

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Okay: Cypher Rose... is a movie, Dr. Blackwell. A spy movie. Came out last year. Made half a billion dollars at the box office. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...oh. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Mr. Middendorf plays Cypher Rose’s love interest, rogue intelligence officer Matthew Diamond. He’s been in Hokkaido for three months now, shooting the second film in the series. Cypher Rose... Two. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Ah.

##### [A PAUSE]

Sorry. I... I don’t really leave the university much these days. I don’t have time for… movies. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

...maybe you should try to find some time. When’s the last time you had a night off?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It’s been... a while. Umm, but okay. So, he’s there, has this massive heart attack. That’s very sad, but... where do we come into it? I’m sure they have good hospitals in Japan. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

_[scoffing]_ Oh, they have absolutely terrific facilities. We’re trying to solve a different problem.  

##### [ANDREA PRODUCES A SHEET OF PAPER AND PASSES IT OVER TO ADAM]
 
#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What’s... what’s this? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

That’s Jenny Hegelmier. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Who’s Jenny Hegelmier?

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Jenny Hegelmier was twenty-four.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Was? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Was. She ran a traffic light this morning, at Milwaukee, North, and Damen. Had a head-on collision. A piece of rebar went through her neck. She died instantly.

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

So she’s dead... 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...but very fortunately... Jenny Hegelmier was a registered organ donor.

##### [A PAUSE]

You’re not going where I think you’re... 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

I’m afraid I am. It’s a perfect match, too, fits what we need on every criteria.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, great - ! 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Except-  

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, of course there’s an except.  

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Eighteen hours. That’s how long, on average, it takes to fly from Chicago to Hokkaido. Transplant operation is four to six hours, and the best, brightest, most gifted people on the premises have made every assurance that if they don’t start in the next… hour and fifty-two minutes, they might as well not even start. We don’t have eighteen hours. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

So they have absolutely terrific hospitals in Japan... 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

...but what they don’t have is a new heart to give Kris Middendorf. But we do, here in Chicago. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Which would be a real problem... 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

...except the other thing we have here in Chicago is a wizard with the supernatural power to teleport matter from one place to another. 
 
#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Fuck... you do need a magician. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

I really, really need a magician. Which brings us to the half a billion dollar question... can you do it? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It’s... it’s... I’m sorry. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Huh. Let me rephrase: I need you to do this. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

That’s great, but - organics are a problem right now.

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

I’ve - I’ve impressed upon you that- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You have, yes. But I haven’t figured out how to - the movement of something as delicate as a heart... 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Dr. Blackwell... 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And - that’s - that’s farther than I’ve ever teleported anything and - and doing a precision jump to somewhere that far away is- 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Doctor Blackwell- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It’s - it’s too much. Too much uncertainty. Too much I can’t guarantee. It’s just- 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

_Adam_. Someone is going to die. If you don’t try, a man is going to die.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I... I can’t. I can’t. I can’t! If I screw it up, if the heart ends up in the wrong place, or if it gets messed up in the- 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

He’ll be no more dead than if you didn’t do anything. But at least- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I hear you, but - there has to be another way, a plane, a jet- 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Oh, a jet that can get literally across the world in under two hours? That’s a fast jet. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Or - another donor. Another heart that’s closer, that’s- 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

That we’ll find and prep and get ready in - I cannot underline this enough - under two hours?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I... 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Do you think I’d be here if I thought there was any other option? Don’t you want to at least try? to give it an... hour and forty-nine minutes’ worth of try? Before you say you can’t? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I...

##### [A PAUSE]

...I need a room with a whiteboard. And I need someone to run back to Sinclair. To pick up some notes from my desk. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

kay. Okay, I can - I can arrange all of that. Thank you.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh... don’t thank me yet. Thank me after this is all over, after I’ve figured out a way to teleport living matter without causing it to explode, and after I’ve figured out how to hit a bull’s eye from seven thousand miles away, and after I haven’t fucked up any of the words I’m about to guesstimate... If we can make all of those fucking miracles happen in the right order... I’ll be very, very happy to say “you’re welcome.”

#### NARRATOR

Sinclair University Hospital. An hour and fifteen minutes later. 

##### [A DOOR OPENS AS ANDREA ENTERS THE ROOM]

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Dr. Blackwell? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Down here. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Why - why are you down there? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Legs got tired. I wanted to sit. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

...why didn’t you get a chair? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Didn’t have time for a chair. Needed to think. The floor’s fine. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

...okay. Is it all right if I join you? 

##### [SHE SITS DOWN NEXT TO HIM]

You... you filled up all three white boards. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, well... I had a lot of figuring out to do.

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

That’s a lot of spells up there. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Not spells. Just spell. One spell. One... very big, very complicated, hopefully very exact spell. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Oh.

##### [A PAUSE]

I’m sorry, by the way. I... haven’t said that yet. It’s... not exactly fair of me to just... barge into your life and foist the responsibility for whether someone lives or dies onto your hands. So... I’m sorry. And thank you. For trying. 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...two people. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

What? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Whether two people live or die. If I screw this up and something happens to the heart, if it explodes or gets lost or... anything, then... well, then we don’t have a heart anymore. And we can’t give it to someone here. I’m sure someone needs it. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Yeah. That’s... that’s very true.

##### [A LONG PAUSE]

I got a call from Hokkaido. They’ve set up an area for you, in front of the hospital. It’s about a hundred square meters, they say, and it’s flat, more or less at local sea level. If you can get the container and its contents in there, they’ll be able to retrieve the heart, so you got a bit of wiggle room. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

A hundred square meters. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

That’s basically the size of four tennis courts. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, just gotta hit four tennis courts from halfway around the world. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Hope you got a good serve. 

##### [THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER, THEN SHARE A TIRED, OVERWHELMED BIT OF LAUGHTER]

Oh god, okay… Want to walk me through it? Would that help? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah. So... problem number one is organic randomization. This is the latest and greatest theory on how to get around that. Basically going... I’d like to move this... container, I guess, whatever we’re keeping the heart in. And I’d like everything in the container to stay the way it is. Veriai Brilgo. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Veriai Brilgo... 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

That’s basically Harbinger magic words for “as is.” I think. I hope. And - and then there’s the issue of teleporting to somewhere I can’t see. It’s hard to give the universe specific directions. But there’s this Harbinger site in Oceania, which had this big... atlas, almost, carved into one of the walls, with these words we’d never seen next to it. This guy at Oxford, Edmund Rowbotham, has this theory that they’re the Harbinger version of coordinates. A way orientating yourself based off of the center of the Earth. I just called him and got the latest download, mapped it onto where we need to go. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Is Edmund Rowbotham good? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Right now I need to operate under the assumption that Eddie Rowbotham is a once-in-a-generation fucking genius, because otherwise we are sunk before we’ve even begun. (A pause.) He’s good. He’s really good. But... this needs to be really, really good. And I don’t have time to make it better, so we are going with it. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

What’s that last section? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

That’s... well...

##### [A PAUSE]

We’re not... a hundred percent on what the... word is. In the Language of the Stars. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

The word for what?

##### [A SMALL PAUSE]

The word for heart?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Depending on how you interpret a couple of the pieces of writing that we’ve found, it might- 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

You have got to be kidding me. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It’s - it’s either one thing or the other. It’s either Amargola or Ennerventia. It’s one or the other. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Do you... need the word? Can’t you just go “make this thing go over there?” 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No. I mean... yes, I could, but the more you rely on the universe knowing what you mean by “this thing” the more you leave yourself open to getting fucked over by a passing trickster god. (A pause.) Amargola. Amargola. It’s amargola. And... as soon as I can get myself sure enough to bet two people’s lives on it... we can get started. 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

It’s going to be okay. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You really don’t know that. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

I do, though. I... I knew the moment I walked into your office and saw you. This is someone who can do the impossible. Not the ring, not the magic, you. And very soon, everyone will know that. And I am so sure that this is where it all happens. This is where it all begins.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I know, you know. I know that you and Amy are friends. In case you were wondering. She used to talk about you a lot. When we were still at Sinclair. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

What did she say? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Just that... you’re kind. And clever. And have great hair.

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

All very true. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah. And... that she genuinely believed with all her heart that you were gonna save the world one day. And that you had this incredible ability to let people see what they were actually capable of. Even when they... didn’t want to. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Jesus Christ, Stirling... Gah, she always saves the best stuff for when you’re not around to stop her, you know.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, I know. 

##### [THE BOTH LAUGH A BIT]

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

She had lots to say about you as well.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah? What did Amy Stirling have to say about me? 

##### [A PAUSE, ANDREA TAKES A BREATH]

Nah. You - you know what? Never mind. Let’s - let’s not get distracted. Do I have five minutes? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

...five minutes is about all we have. They need it now if they’re going to operate.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay. I just... let me call my professor. He’s the world’s best expert on Harbinger linguistics. Let me just... make sure I’m not about to miss anything obvious. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

All right. Just... make it quick, please. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

VI will. I’ll be right there.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You’ve been unusually quiet today. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

I’m just... shocked. I can’t believe you actually went along with this. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I know. Blame Andrea Fucking Shepherd. I think if it had been anyone else, I would have stuck to my original guns.

##### [A PAUSE]

It was an insane risk to take. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

What happened? After you got your last minute check from McCandless? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well...

Gentlemen - is that - ? Okay, good. Thank you. Bring it here, please.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

That’s it, then? In that container?

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

That’s it.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It’s smaller than I thought it’d be. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Yeah. It’s tiny.

##### [A PAUSE]

You’re ready. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I... I think so, yeah. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

It wasn’t a question. You’re ready. You can do this, Adam.

Yeah, I... I think so. You all right?

Yeah, just... just some glass in my hair, I think.

##### [A PAUSE]

Adam... what the fuck was that? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

 I... I don’t know. It had never been like that. I... I don’t know if the universe likes getting instructions that are... that are worded like that. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Yeah. Maybe... maybe not. 

##### [A PAUSE, THEN ANDREA'S PHONE VIBRATES WITH AN INCOMING CALL, SHE PICKS IT UP AT ONCE]

Shepherd. 

##### [A PAUSE]

Yeah?

##### [A PAUSE]

Confirmed, it’s there? 

##### [ADAM LETS OUT A RELIVED BREATH]

Yeah, yeah? And it’s in - it’s in good condition? In one piece? It is? Good. Good.

Oh my god.

Okay, great. Thank you. Now go finish the job. Bye. 

##### [SHE HANGS UP]

You did it, man. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh my god... don’t - don’t mind me, I’m just gonna... pass out for a little bit here, all right? _[he laughs a bit]_ You are... very, very, very welcome.

##### [BOTH ADAM AND ANDREA LET OUT A VERY RELIEVED BURST OF LAUGHTER]


-----


#### ADAM BLACKWELL 

And that was pretty much it. The spell worked, the heart made it to Hokkaido. The doctors performed the transplant, and five hours later Kris Middendorf had a new heart. Three months later, he finished shooting his part for Cypher Rose Two. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And you had a solution for your organic and your long-distance problems. The Most Powerful Man in the World gets more powerful. Why did your spell react that way? Make the room shake, break things? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, that... unnerved me. At the time I figured it had something to do with the length of the spell. The was... easily six or seven times longer than anything I’d ever tried before. I thought it might be like... leaving an open paren for too long. At a certain point, the person that’s taking dictation starts wanting you to wrap it up already. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

A parenthesis? Or... a door?

##### [A LONG PAUSE]

So... then what? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Then... that was it. Ms. Shepherd and I shook hands and I went back to the university. I made her promise that absolutely no one would know of my involvement in what happened that day. But she’s her. So, naturally, by the next day... 


------


#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Good morning, everybody, let’s get - whoa! 

##### [THE ROOM BURSTS INTO APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

Okay, okay, thank you everyone- 

##### [MORE APPLAUSE AND CHEERS, SOME STUDENTS BANG ON THEIR DESK]

Right, okay, that’s more than enough, let’s- 

##### [THE OVATION GOES ON AND ON]

Oh god... 

##### [THE APPLAUSE KEEPS GOING]


------


#### ADAM BLACKWELL

That was the moment something broke. I... I’d gotten involved now. I couldn’t just hide at the university anymore. The Most Powerful Man in the World had used his powers to change the course of a man’s life. I was on the game board now. Whether I realized it or not. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

God... 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

I swear to god... I sometimes think that you are so set on digging your own grave. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

That’s not- 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

You saved a man’s life. You took a man who was going to die a stupid, pointless, young death and you spared him from that. There are so few things in life that are an absolute good, and you did one of them. Can you not let yourself enjoy it? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It’s... it’s just hard. With everything that happened afterwards.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Anything else? Anything else I need to know about that day? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I... I don’t think so.

##### [A PAUSE]

No. That’s... that’s all there is to it.

Okay. Okay... thank you, Amy. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Yeah, don’t... don’t mention it. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, really. Thanks. I... I need to go... do a thing. But... really. You’re a life-saver. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Anytime, Adam. 

##### [ADAM HANGS UP THE CALL]

Thank you, Amy.

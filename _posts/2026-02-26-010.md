##### [SOUNDS OF ADAM'S OFFICE AT SINCLAIR UNIVERSITY]

#### NARRATOR

Sinclair University. January third, 2029. 

##### [ADAM RIFLES THROUGH SOME PAPERS]
##### [THERE'S A KNOCK ON THE DOOR]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Come in. 

#### REKHA KOTHARI

Hey, Dr. Blackwell. They just sent up another box. You want it with the other ones? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Over there, thank you. 

##### [FOOTSTEPS, REKHA PUTS THE BOX DOWN]

#### REKHA KOTHARI

You’ve been putting a lot of hours into this. Are you... looking for anything in particular?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Just... something I missed. Maybe. 

#### REKHA KOTHARI

Okay. Well... I’m right outside if you need anything, all right? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah. Thank you, Rekha. 

##### [REKHA LEAVES, SHUTTING THE DOOR BEHIND HER]

...oh. Here we go... 

##### [HE UNFOLDS A PIECE OF PAPER]

#### KRIS MIDDENDORF

Dear Dr. Blackwell. I’ve been told in no uncertain terms, that you are not interested in meeting me - that the sort of press and attention that would come from that would be both an inconvenience to you and a hindrance to your work. It’s also been impressed upon me that any hint of a recompense or a reward would be seen as the deadliest of insults. As someone with a bit of experience with life in the public eye, I can only understand these positions all too well, and wouldn’t so much as dream of disrespecting them. However, given that every day that I have ahead of me and every good moment that I will experience from here on out is thanks to you, I would lie awake at night if I didn’t find some way to try to express the gratitude I feel towards you. As such, I hope that receiving a humble letter from an avid fan will only be mildly in opposition to your wishes, and that you’ll receive it in the spirit of deep gratitude and profound admiration in which it is intended. I do not know in what way an actor could ever be of help to a man who is changing the world, but if the day ever comes? Just say the word and I will do everything in my power to be of assistance. Because I mean it: I believe you are changing the world. You’ve changed my world, infinitely for the better, and I hope that wherever life takes us you can always hold onto that. And that I’ll be just the first of many. Gratefully and admiringly yours, Kris Middendorf. May second, 2028. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL 

Fuck... Rekha! 

##### [THE DOOR OPENS AS REKHA RE-ENTERS THE ROOM]

#### REKHA KOTHARI

Yeah? Do you want me to try to get another box tonight?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, that’s all right. I think I’m done for the night, actually. 

#### REKHA KOTHARI

You sure? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, you can head out. Thank you. Actually... if you have ten minutes, could you help me out with one more thing? I... I need to book a flight to Boston.

##### [THE SOUNDS OF CLAUDIA SKINNER'S OFFICE]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

So... between 2026 and 2028 you rarely, if ever, set foot outside your precious university. Then... we get to 2029. And you start working with Jerome Eckerberg. What brought on the sudden change? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well... a lot of things had evolved since I got magic. I’d gotten better at it, gotten a better handle on how it works. Amy had made it palatable, something people could wrap their heads around. And... not to put too fine a point on it, but it wasn’t just the two of us anymore. The Doomscroller had turned the governments of half the Western World upside down. Christmas Eve mass in Buenos Aires was attended by eight million people. The containment seal was very much broken. So, I thought... if people are using magic, I might as well try to put it to good use. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Really? Because I heard you did it because your ex-girlfriend started going out with a movie star and you suddenly felt like you had something to prove. 

##### [PAUSE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

_[clearly offended and has taken the bait]_ Okay, that is - that had absolutely nothing to do with - I didn’t do it because of that. What you need to understand is that my relationship with Amy is complicated, all right? We’re - we’re peers and colleagues and the only people that really understand what the other has gone through, so we take each other seriously, even if we don’t always agree. And she had been telling me - telling me for years - that I should be doing more with my magic, and I finally started listening to her, is that a crime?! But any feelings that I might have had towards her were - you know what? I’m really tired of you calling her my “ex-girlfriend.” We went on one date, five years ago, and that is it. So my relationship with Amy had nothing to do with me agreeing to work with Eckerberg, understood? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

So, for the record? When you’re in front of congress and Hunter Kane from the State of Ohio asks you that - because Hunter Kane from the State of Ohio is going to ask you that, and he is going to call Ms. Stirling your ex - I would advise you leave it at, “My relationship with Ms. Stirling didn’t enter into that decision, sir.” 

##### [ADAM TAKES A DEEP BREATH]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Curveball? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Curveball.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And that’s why you’ve been calling Amy - ? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

No, I’ve been calling her your ex-girlfriend because in the eyes of the world she is your ex, Dr. Blackwell. The nuance of, “We went out once” is not going to sink in any time soon. 

##### [A PAUSE, THEN A PEN SCRATCHES A MARK ON A PIECE OF PAPER]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Eight to three. Just in case you were wondering. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

We are going to have to talk about it sooner or later, you know? The fact that Amy started going out with the man whose life you saved. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, that’s gonna be a laugh and a half... If we can talk about it later, let’s talk about it later. 

##### [SKINNER FLIPS A PIECE OF PAPER AROUND]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Okay. January 2029. You tour the Athena facilities. How did that go?

#### NARRATOR 

Athena Energy Labs, Boston. January Eighth, 2029. 

##### [A BEEP, FOLLOWED BY A FUTURISTIC DOOR SLIDING OPEN]

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Please, Dr. Blackwell, after you. Can I get you anything? A coffee, a tea? Something stronger? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I’m all right, Mr. Eckerberg. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Are you sure? We have a sixty year old Balvenie somewhere around here.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Maybe later.

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Very well. I gotta tell you, doctor, I’m just besides myself to finally have you here. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And I’m... not entirely sure what it is I’m supposed to be doing here. What does... trying to find this door of yours even look like?

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

We... won’t be doing that. Not today. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...we won’t?

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

It’s on the docket, Dr. Blackwell, but first... I want to show you a different project of ours. One you might be able to help us with. It’s the main reason why I wanted you to come out here. After you’ve seen this... I think you’ll understand. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And you didn’t mention this because...? Fine. Fine. Why don’t you... start with where “here” is, exactly? 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Athena Energy’s new flagship facility. I’ve spent years - and a couple billion dollars - building this place. Officially, it’s the Garamond Building. Unofficially, most of my employees call it The Observatory.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Why? 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Because of what we’re trying to harness here: _star power_. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You know, I read a little about places like this, and I gotta say: your “Observatory” doesn’t make a lot of sense. Energy laboratories, R&D facilities, they’re supposed to be out in the middle of nowhere, where you can run big experiments. Or if you’re working with solar, where you can get intense sunlight for sixteen hours a day. So I’m just kinda wondering... 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

...why set up shop in a city that is infamous for its grey, gloomy weather? Boston has things that are essential for my work. Even more essential than sunlight. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What kinds of things? 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Things like M.I.T. And Harvard. And Northeastern and Boston College and the Pryce Robotics Institute. The best and brightest come to study here, all ready to take on the world and think outside the box.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And all that makes up for the shitty weather? 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Adam... what I’m about to show you? Less than two hundred people have seen it. Less than a two thousand know about it. When this is done? It’s going to change the world. Forever. Here, step this way... 

##### [FOOTSTEPS]

Adam... this is the observatory. 

##### [ECKERBERG PRESSES A BUTTON CAUSING A PANEL TO RISE, REVEALING A WINDOW THAT LEADS DEEPER INTO THE FACILITY – VARIOUS HIGH-TECH SOUNDS CAN BE HEARD THROUGH THE WALL]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh my... what - what is this place? What are you doing here? 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Well... to answer your earlier question... we can harness star power here despite the weather... because we’re building one.  

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You’re building one... what? 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

A star, Dr. Blackwell. We’re building a star. Maybe now’s a good time for that whiskey? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, I think that’s a good idea... 


------


#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

So, did it never occur to you -  

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, wait, wait - 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

–to ask if having a facility like this one –

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

That’s not fair, I - 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

–in a major center of commerce and culture and industry and education –

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You can’t - 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

–not to mention the home of thousands of people - 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I don’t - 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

–was a good, prudent, safe idea? 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Can I speak now? Yeah. I asked. I asked because I remembered Chernobyl, and Fukushima and Three Mile Island and - I asked, okay? Of course I asked, the man said he was building a star in a basement in Boston! 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And... if I remembered those things? Eckerberg had studied them. He’d dissected them, looked at them from every angle. And so there were... precautions and failsafes and redundancies and protocols to - _[takes a deep breath]_ He got it. They were doing everything right. They had a plan for even the most... remote possibilities of what could possibly go wrong.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Not quite every possibility. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, well... no matter how well prepared you are, every now and then a curveball catches you off-guard. 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

You’re saying “they.” Who’s they? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

His team. The people designing his star. His... how did he put it? 

##### [SKINNER FLIPS A PAGE OVER]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

The “blisteringly smart people he had working for him.” 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, that. And I was about to meet the most blistering of them of all.

#### NARRATOR

The Observatory. Main Generator Room. Half an hour later. 

##### [FOOTSTEPS AS ADAM AND ECKERBERG WALK THROUGH THE SPACE]

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

All the major components are up there. The reactor, the vacuum vessel... magnets for the plasma, of course. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Of... course.

##### [A WOMAN'S LAUGHTER]

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Oh, let’s stop here for a moment, there’s someone you - Mel! Mel! 

##### [MOVEMENT AS DOCTOR MELISSA ERICKSON WALKS UP TO THEM]

Dr. Melissa Erickson, allow me to introduce - 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Oh, fuck, you’re - The Most Powerful Man in the World. It’s nice to meet you, man. 

##### [SHE SHAKES ADAM'S HAND]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Umm, it’s a pleasure. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Mr. E, you didn’t say your magician was such a fox. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

_[flustered]_ Uhh, I, that’s - 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

You bring a handsome man to my lab on a day when I don’t have my cute lab coat on? Tsk, tsk, Mr. E.

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

My apologies. It won’t happen again. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

ee that it doesn’t. Sorry about the messy get-up, I was just making some adjustments up in the vac. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Umm, no, that’s all - it’s your lab. I... I like your mask. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Yeah? I designed this model myself. Not your grandma’s welding mask. We’ve straightened up that transfer inefficiency, by the way. Ves should feel better. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Good. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Ves? 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

The largest fusion power generator in the world. The crown jewel of the Observatory. Project Vesper. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

My baby. She’s got my eyes, I know. Everyone says so. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Dr. Erickson’s official title is project lead on Vesper. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

That’s just because someone was too much of a stick in the mud to let me put “star forger” on my office door.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, wait, but... what, exactly are you doing here? 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Dr. Blackwell... how much do you know about energy fusion? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I could... use a refresher, I suppose. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Right. Well: fusion is the energy source that we get in the sun. You take a helium-three atom, combine it with the active elements of a tritium isotope, apply... 


------


#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Okay, wait, wait, wait - 

##### [A RECORD SCRATCH BRINGS US BACK TO SKINNER'S OFFICE]

Dr. Blackwell... do you have an advanced degree? What’s it in? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...anthropology. A master’s. And a doctorate in archeology. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And which one of those qualifies you to explain the intricacies of experimental physics projects? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

All right, hold on - 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Oh, neither? Because it sure seemed like you were about to –

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

She was an expert! She was the expert and she was the one who - Okay, if I get asked about this, what am I supposed to say? 

##### [A FAST WHIPPING SOUND BRINGS US BACK TO THE OBSERVATORY]

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

I’m gonna do some super science-y mumbo jumbo that is going to just physics the shit out of the whole fucking world. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

The science shit that we’re gonna do here is gonna get real... physics-y.

##### [ERICKSON AND ECKERBERG TURN TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND SHARE A HIGH-FIVE]

##### [ANOTHER FAST WHIPPING SOUND BRINGS US BACK TO SKINNER'S OFFICE]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Adam, the last thing you want is to be seen as putting on airs of being an expert in matters you don’t know anything about. Especially given -  

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yes, yes, I know, I know. Look, Mel... Dr. Erickson had to explain it to me a couple of times. Dumb it down a bit. If we acknowledge that I am so not the person to be explaining this... how about I take us through the layman’s explanation she gave me?

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

...I’ll allow it. What’d she say? 

##### [ANOTHER WHIP]

------

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

All right, let’s try it this way... Here, hold onto this glass of water for me.

##### [A RUSTLE AS ADAM TAKES THE GLASS OF WATER FROM HER]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay... 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

So - atoms release energy when they fuse to other atoms. Not... all atoms and not in all circumstances, but for now: atoms join with other atoms, you get energy. Yeah? Stars make atoms fuse together. They do this by being, I cannot emphasize this enough, fucking huge. They’re so big that everything at their core has an enormous amount of pressure being applied to it. We can’t do that. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Because...?

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Because doing that would require building something with more mass in it than the entire Earth. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

We cannot do that. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

So if you can’t apply stellar pressure, you find an alternative. Best candidate so far was adding enough energy to agitate the atoms to the point that they’ll stick together. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You need to spend energy to make energy? 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Snappily put, Dr. Blackwell. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

There’s a point at which it’s self-sustaining. Where it’s outputting more energy than it’s taking in. We call that point ignition.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And you can’t do that? 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Theoretically we can. But getting our technological ducks in a row to figure out how to do it is probably gonna take another decade or three.  

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Except you said that was the best alternative so far. Past tense.

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Magic, looks, and brains. You found me a man for all seasons, Mr. E. Yeah. You’re the better idea.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

How am I the better idea? 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Think of it this way. You’re trying to put a lot of pressure on something. Say... a quarter. You pick it up, and you close your fist around it, hard as you can, and squeeze and squeeze and squeeze. That works fine. But what if you could close your fist first, so tight you leave no space at all... and then put something in there? That’s pressure of a whole different kind.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You... you want me to teleport something into Vesper? 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Just a tiny, little itty bit of... well, plasma. That’s all. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You want me to teleport plasma into your homemade star?

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

No. I want you to teleport plasma into my big scary generator so we can get to ignition. To... make Vesper into a homemade star.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I... I don’t know. Look, this stuff can be unpredictable, especially if I’m not teleporting things into open spaces. And if I don’t word things very carefully, and it’s anything other than inorganic solids, a lot of the things that I teleport have a tendency to - 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

–kind of just explode? As if there had been a reaction? Like a lot of energy had been released, all at once? Maybe because things had gotten... pressed together? You’re not the only one with brains around here, Dr. Blackwell. We’d go slow. You’re gonna tell me everything you know about how your powers work. I’m gonna tell you everything about how Vesper works. And when I’m happy, and you’re happy, and a bunch of other very smart, very paranoid people are happy... we’ll try it. Okay?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah... okay... 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Good. All right, hang out here for juuust a second. Let me get some plans that’ll help to illustrate some of the more... esoteric parts of this. I’ll be right back! 

##### [FOOTSTEPS AS MELISSA ERICKSON DEPARTS]

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

To answer your question: yes. She’s always like that. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Heh, okay... sure... Uuh, wait: what did any of that have to do with this glass of water she gave me?

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Because once we get to the point of ignition? The hydrogen atoms in that glass of water is all the fuel we’ll need to power the city of Boston for three months. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Jesus. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Dr. Erickson’s the one that first theorized that you’re getting the energy for your magic from somewhere else. Once Vesper is up and running? She’s very excited to to find that door. To figure out what walking through it might look like. This is just the beginning, Adam. Just the beginning. 


------


#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And did you know? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What? That I’d just signed the death warrant for six-hundred and forty-five thousand people? No, I did not know. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And so you became a part of Project Vesper. How’d it treat you? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It was... an adjustment. The first few weeks were all data-gathering experiments with Dr. Erickson. Teleport this there. Teleport it back. Teleport it with this sensor attached to it. Teleport it with this sensor attached to you. Teleport it to this box, teleport it with a fox. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

You were there the whole time? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, no. When the term started at Sinclair, I went back. Kept teaching. I’d go back to Boston, on the weekends, on days when I could get away. Mr. Eckerberg was very generous with the use of his private airplane. And then... things just kind of stopped for a while. Dr. Erickson had been so excited, it had felt like we were close to... something. But they just stopped calling for a few weeks. Until one day out of the blue, my phone rang. They were ready. Ready for a big test. They wanted me back in Boston as soon as possible.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And did it occur to you - ?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, of course it didn’t - 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Let me finish, did it - ? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It would have been insane for me - 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

I am just saying, at any point - ?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, it fucking didn’t! I’m sorry. I’m sorry, finish the question. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

...did it ever occur to you... that there might have been something else happening? For example: a new president taking office. One that Mr. Eckerberg had ties to. One that might have removed some roadblocks that were preventing this test from happening in the middle of a very important, very populated urban center? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No. It really, really should have. But... it didn’t. I didn’t know how connected he was to the campaign, I didn’t know how much he’d invested into her presidency, or how President Shepherd had gotten involved in the work Athena was doing. Maybe I could have if I’d been paying more attention or been cleverer or... but it didn’t. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Okay. Walk me through the day of the test, please. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I flew out the night before. Got put up at some fancy hotel downtown. Eckerberg shouldn’t have even bothered, I barely slept at all that night. Then... eight AM the next morning, I made my way to the Observatory. Eckerberg said that it was a completely private test, absolutely closed to everyone. So naturally, when I got there, there were fifty people I’d never seen in the control room. Investors, professors, scientists, a few people from the White House... that was the first time I realized how big this was.

Okay... this is new. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

_[through an overhead speaker]_ Adam? Can you hear me? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, Mel, I can hear you. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Good. Hey, remember, this thing is gonna make a lot of big noises, but that’s the way it’s supposed to be, yeah? So keep breathing, okay? Oxygen’s good for you. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I’ll do my best. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

That’s all I can ask for. Now... right by where you are, there should be a small metal container. You see it? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

 Yeah, I got it. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Great. That’s the package. When I tell you to, you deliver what’s inside there right to Vesper’s core, all right?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You got it. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

You need any more calibrations, any more practice runs? You want to fine tune the wording on the spell? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No. I got it. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Hell yeah, you got it. All right, Adam, we’re gonna start pressurizing the core. Stand by. 

##### [THE MACHINE RUMBLES TO LIFE, VARIOUS PARTS START TO POWER UP AND MOVE]

This is all normal, okay? This is all expected noises. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, I remember. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Good, good. By the way, is that a new cologne? It’s nice. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What are you doing, Mel? 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Oh, you know, flirting to distract you from the big scary noises the nuclear device is making.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Aren’t there, like, a sixty people watching and listening right now? 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Don’t tell me you’re gonna go shy on me, you were doing so well... 

##### [THE MACHINERY LETS OUT A KA-KLUNK SOUND AND A HISS OF STEAM]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, uh, no, that’s - that’s really all right, it’s - 

##### [FOOTSTEPS AS ECKERBERG APPROACHES]

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Doctor Blackwell. 

##### [THEY SHAKE HANDS]

You’ve just changed the world, my friend. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, no, that’s - 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

No, listen to him. You just changed the world. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It worked, then? It’s what you needed? 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Juuust a moment... 

##### [A COMPUTER CONSOLE AROUND HER BEEPS SLIGHTLY AS SHE LOOKS OVER SOME READOUTS]

Oh, you sexy, sexy thing. Output’s clean. Steady transfer. All around... exceeds expectations. We did it. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You did it. Congratulations, Mel.  

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

You should be getting a big hug right now, but I’m air traffic controlling this whole thing. Mr. E, could you hug Adam for me? 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Maybe later. But for now... you should both be besides yourself with pride. This is proof it’s viable. With your magic, Dr. Blackwell, we can get to fusion. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Well, it could be more than that... 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Mel? What do you mean?  

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Zhou, proof me. Are these numbers right? Do these actually line up? 

#### TECH

I mean... oh. Oh. You don’t want to actually...? 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

We could, couldn’t we? 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Dr. Erickson...? 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Well... it’s a better transfer than we were expecting. By a factor of... fifteen at least. We could just... let it run. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Wait, what? 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Just, you know... see how far it gets. See if we can actually get to full ignition.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Is that - is that safe?

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Oh, absolutely. We can pull the plug anytime. I mean, boss... this is already a huge success, but... a successful ignition test? In front of this crowd? Come on... 

##### [A PAUSE... AND THEN...]

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Ladies and gentlemen... when I asked you to come here today, I told you it was to see something remarkable. The coming together of magic and science to prove that today’s dream can be tomorrow’s reality. But the truth is... I’d always hoped that we’d be able to show you a little bit more than that. So if you could all please wait just a moment... and hold your breaths... with a bit of luck, you’re about to see irrefutable proof that in just a few short years? Athena will be able to bring clean, efficient energy to the whole world. 

##### [HE TURNS AWAY FROM THE CROWD OF VIPS AND BACK TOWARDS ERICKSON]

Dr. Erickson... let it run. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

All right boys and girls... this is now officially a full fusion energy ignition test. Get me readings please. 

##### [ERICKSON AND THE TECHS GET TO WORK ON VARIOUS CONSOLES, THROUGH THE WALL THE MACHINERY OF VESPER'S FUSION CORE GROWS LOUDER AND MORE POWERFUL]

##### [AFTER A MOMENT, THERE'S THE SOUND OF A LOUD POWER SURGE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh my god... 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Zhou? Talk to me... 

#### TECH

Just... just a second... 

##### [THE MACHINERY KEEPS SPINNING, OCCASIONALLY LETTING OUT A SPARKING ELECTRICAL SOUND]

#### TECH

Okay... output is reading in at... Seven point nine megajoules per. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Is that - is that good? 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

That’s... that’s enough to power half the city. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

See boss? Told you it would work. All it needed was a little magic. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Yes, yes! I told you, Dr. Blackwell: this is a before and - 

##### [AN ALARM GOES OFF FROM ONE OF THE CONSOLES]

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Rosales? 

#### TECH 2

Structural warning, boss. We’re getting a... little bit of instability. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Instability?

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Diagnostics, please. What’s causing it? What’s the - ? 

##### [METAL STRUCTURES AROUND THEM START TO GROAN AS THE MACHINERY GETS EVEN LOUDER AND MORE OMINOUS]

#### TECH

Umm, Dr. Erickson? Energy output’s rising... we’re up to twelve megajoules. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Okay... okay... Boss, I think we can call this a successful test, but it feels like - 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Agreed. End it. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

All right, all hands, termination sequence. Quickly, quickly.

##### [THE TECHS WORK AT THEIR CONSOLES]

#### TECH 2

Umm... termination sequence... non-responsive. Reaction continues. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Excuse me? 

#### TECH

We’re up to seventeen megajoules. It’s... it’s not slowing down. 

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Run it again please, route the command through the energy input line and - oh for god’s, let me - 

##### [DR ERICKSON STARTS TYPING INTO ONE OF THE CONSOLES]

Dammit... trying again... 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What - what happens if you can’t stop it? How much will it - ?

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Adam, please: keep your voice down. No need to panic our guests. Dr. Erickson has this well in hand. You know that, right? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah. I know. 

#### TECH

Twenty-nine megajoules... and... is anyone else feeling... ?

##### [THE MACHINE GETS EVEN LOUDER, THE BUILDING AROUND THEM RUMBLES]

#### TECH 2

We’re getting more instability... kinda getting close to the upper thresholds here... 

#### TECH

Thirty-seven megajoules... and rising... 

##### [THE GENERATOR RISES TO A FEVERED PITCH]

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Mel...?

#### MELISSA ERICKSON

Just... give me... a... moment... to... 

##### [DR ERICKSON PUTS SOME COMMANDS INTO A CONSOLE... AND VARIOUS MACHINES FINALLY START TO POWER DOWN – SEVERAL ALARMS STOP GOING OFF]

Okay. Termination sequence completed. Event finalized. We’re good.  

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Thank you. 

##### [HE TURNS BACK TOWARDS THE VIPS]

All right, a slightly more... exciting conclusion to today’s little demonstration than we expected, but nothing our team couldn’t handle. And this is just the very exciting beginning.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

After that, the rest of the day was... champagne. Toasts. People slapping each other on the back. Talking about the big bright beautiful tomorrow. Of how this would change things. Help the economy. Save the environment. Make the world taste good. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

What about you? How did you feel? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...weirdly? Numb. Like I... couldn’t quite figure out what I’d just seen. But at the same time? Reassured. Something had gone wrong. And they... they dealt with it. Just stopped it in its tracks. It felt like they knew what they were doing. Still... I spent the whole flight back to Chicago replaying everything that had happened in my head, over and over again.

#### NARRATOR

Sinclair University. Adam Blackwell’s Office. Two days after Athena Energy fusion test. 

##### [ADAM OPENS THE DOOR AND ENTERS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay... what did I miss while I - ?

#### AMY STIRLING

Jerome Eckerberg.

##### [HE YELPS, STARTLED AT HER SUDDEN PRESENCE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Jesus. Amy, what are you - ?

##### [AMY SHOVES HIM]

#### AMY STIRLING

Jerome Eckerberg. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Hey, easy. How did you even get - 

##### [SHE SHOVES HIM AGAIN]

#### AMY STIRLING

Jerome Fucking Eckerberg. You’re working with Je- 

##### [SHE REACHES OUT TO SHOVE HIM AGAIN, BUT ADAM CATCHES HER HANDS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, that’s enough! Yes. Yes, okay? I am. 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### AMY STIRLING

Adam, can you let go of my wrists, please? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

If I do, are you gonna shove me again?

#### AMY STIRLING

No, I think I’m done with that now. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay then. 

##### [HE LETS GO AND AMY SHOVES HIM AGAIN]

Hey!

#### AMY STIRLING

Okay, now, I’m done. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

God... all right to ask one of the about fifty-two questions that are being begged right now... how? How do you know I’m working with him? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Well, Adam, you see: I’m a very clever girl, I’m friends with the president, and - oh yes, little thing - I can read fucking minds.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, fine. So let’s move onto - and I cannot wait to hear what frankly insane train of thought is about to run me over here - what is the problem, Amy? 

#### AMY STIRLING

The problem? I don’t know, Adam. How about the fact that you’re putting your magic at the feet of a billionaire who already has too much power? Or how you’re helping him corner the global market in energy? Or - oh, here’s a good one -  you’re helping a guy go from having fuck you amounts of money to having fuck you fuck you fuck you I own the planet amounts of money?!

##### [SHE SHOVES HIM AGAIN]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You said we were done with the shoving! 

#### AMY STIRLING

I was wrong, sue me! I thought I could... not trust you, exactly. But... at least leave you alone! You turned down so many people, Adam. So many people that wanted your magic. Just because all you wanted to do was stay in this fucking university and study. And even though I couldn’t believe it, at least you weren’t working with people like Eckerberg. So I gotta ask: how did he finally get you to crack? What did he offer, what’s he giving you? What did he say to - ? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

He didn’t say anything, okay?! It wasn’t anything he said, it was - 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### AMY STIRLING

What? What was it? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...it was what you said, Amy. What you’ve been saying for years. “No one has ever changed the world by sitting in an ivory tower.” So I’m - I’m getting out of the ivory tower. I’m using my powers to do some good, to do... to do something. The way you’ve always wanted.

##### [A PAUSE]

#### AMY STIRLING

So... what you got out of all of that... was, “Please go help a billionaire get richer - “

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, that’s - 

#### AMY STIRLING

“- and more powerful -”

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

That is not - 

#### AMY STIRLING

“- and more dangerous?” You are - 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

That is not what I am doing! Amy, what do you actually know about what he’s doing? About how he’s going after it? About the precautions, the fail-safes, the safety measures? About what this kind of energy becoming viable could do for all of us? Because you said - you said - that if you have power you’re supposed to use it save the world. Well, I’m -

#### AMY STIRLING

No. You aren’t saving the world, you’re helping one of the guys who thinks he owns the world get closer to actually owning it. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Who cares what - ? This is bigger than him! This is about what he’s trying to develop. Once he’s made it happen, we have it, and we can use it, and the world can be a better place long after he’s gone. Isn’t that worth it? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Pro tip, dude: Playing devil’s advocate for the billionaire oligarchy is so not the move.

##### [ADAM LETS OUT A LOW BREATH]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

When I don’t do anything with my magic... I’m an asshole. When I do something with my magic... I’m an asshole. I just... I can’t win with you, Amy, can I?

##### [A PAUSE]

All right... anything else you want to get off your chest, Amy?

#### AMY STIRLING

ust... be careful. Be so goddamn careful around Eckerberg, okay?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Amy... do you know something? Something about Eckerberg? Something I should know? 

#### AMY STIRLING

No, Adam, I just... I just don’t want you to make a mistake you won’t be able to fix, okay?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

But - 

#### AMY STIRLING

I gotta go. I’ll see you. 

##### [AMY LEAVES, SHUTTING THE DOOR BEHIND HER AS SHE EXITS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...yeah. Always nice talking to you, Amy. 

##### [CLOSING THEME BEGINS]

Today’s history tidbit: on February 26th, 2023, an expose in the West Coast Gazette revealed a long history of corruption and inhumane treatment within the Agnus Dei religious organization. Its founder, Lawrence Donahue, publicly denied the claims and swore to continue fighting for his followers and his beliefs.

summary:         "When Amy Stirling met Adam Blackwell, it was pretty much hate at first sight. From the earliest days of their relationship, the two of them were bitter rivals and ideological opposites. But did it always have to be this way? In those early days, was there ever a chance for something more between the man and the woman who would forever change the course of history?"

##### [SOUNDS OF A UNIVERSITY HALLWAY FADE IN]

#### NARRATOR

Sinclair University. Registrar. September, 2024. 

#### AMY STIRLING

I remember the first day that I met Adam Blackwell. 

##### [SOME FOOTSTEPS APPROACH]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...it’ll be fine, Paul, trust me. Julian - I mean, Professor McCandless - he can seem intimidating at first. And he’ll put you through a bit of a ringer. But just take it one day at a time. And do the work. It’ll be fine, trust me. 

##### [ANOTHER SET OF FOOTSTEPS APPROACH]

#### AMY STIRLING

Umm, excuse me? 

##### [ALL THE FOOTSTEPS COME TO A STOP]

Sorry to just totally horn in on your conversation, but... are you in the anthro department? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Ummm...

#### AMY STIRLING

Sorry, I must seem like a total - I’m Amy. I’m starting the masters program here. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, sure. I’m Adam, this is Paul. We’ll - we’ll be in the same cohort, actually.

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh my god, that’s brilliant. Nice to meet you guys. But, umm, could you help me out for a second, because I am lost right now. Do you know where Rogers Hall is?

##### [ADAM CHUCKLES]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah. We’re both lifers, so... Oh, umm, we both did our undergrad here. We know our way around. Okay, so what you wanna do is go straight down the green, until you get to the big fountain and - have you seen the big fountain already? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Yes. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, good. So you go there, then you go around the black building with all the ivy. Then you see this red brick place with this weird... I guess kinda tower thing? You can’t miss it. That’s Rogers. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Amazing. You are a life-saver. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh no, it’s, like - there are basically no signs anywhere on campus for some reason. It’s a real trial by fire. 

#### AMY STIRLING

That makes me feel like so much less of an idiot. Let me just... write down everything you just said... 

##### [AMY BEGINS TO TAP ON HER PHONE]

So you, uh, you’ve taken classes with McCandless, then? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Uh, yeah, you know... one or two. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Is he as... I don’t know, as everything as the stories make him sound? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Ehhh, you know... elcora krelekar dactum eldregin. 

##### [A PAUSE, AMY STOPS WRITING ON HER PHONE]

Excuse me?

#### AMY STIRLING

Elcora krelekar dactum eldregin?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I’m - I’m sorry, what? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh, I... I was just saying that he might be the smartest man in the world. I just - sorry, I thought if you were in the grad program, you’d at least have a rough handle on the Language of the Sun. 

##### [AMY LETS OUT A LITTLE LAUGH]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You... might want to brush up on that before the first session. Just... something to think about. 

#### AMY STIRLING

...sure. I’ll... think about it. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Cool. Umm, we should run but... good luck with... Rogers Hall.

##### [SOME FOOTSTEPS AS ADAM AND PAUL START TO MOVE AWAY]

#### AMY STIRLING

Your subjunctive sucks, dude. 

##### [THE FOOTSTEPS STOP]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Uhh, excuse me? 

#### AMY STIRLING

You may have meant to say that he might be the smartest man in the world, but what you actually said was that he would be the most world smart man. That’s why I was so confused. Eldora krelakar dactior ulder-ergin would have been a better way of getting your idea across. Also, your pronunciation is super fucking messy - you’re not trilling your r’s at all, and your stress pattern is barely there, which doesn’t help anything. Sorta seems like you’ve maybe spent a lot of time reading the Harbinger languages but not a lot of time actually saying the stuff out loud, which is the thing we really worked at back when I was at _Princeton_. You might want to - you know - brush up on that before we get started. Just something to think about. See you in class. 

##### [FOOTSTEPS AS AMY DEPARTS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What in all the fuck just happened? 

#### AMY STIRLING

It wasn’t quite hate at first sight, but... well, it was about as close as you could get.

##### [SKINNER FLIPS THROUGH SOME PAGES]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Let’s take a moment to discuss your relationship with Dr. Blackwell. If you had to describe your feelings towards him as... vividly yet succinctly as possible... how would you do it? 

#### AMY STIRLING

You know... there’s this concept in Harbinger mythology, what they called a mulkadir. It’s the idea that for every person there is a... disaster that has been sent to Earth. And I mean a disaster, like a hurricane or a flood or a volcano or something. And it was put on Earth specifically to test them. Sooner or later you meet yours, and it either makes you stronger... or it breaks you. I think Adam Blackwell might be my mulkadir. 

###### [SKINNER TAKES SOME NOTES]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

So safe to say there’s some animosity between the two of you? 

#### AMY STIRLING

I don’t know. You spend half a decade fighting a volcano, at a certain point you kinda start to respect the damn thing.

##### [SKINNER FLIPS A PAGE]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

You first met as graduate students in the same cohort. You disliked each other. Was there a point at which things... escalated? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Yeah. It escalated with the assignment. It was... late in our first year. And Professor McCandless asked us to stay after class one day. 

##### [TRANSITION SOUND]

#### NARRATOR

Sinclair University. April, 2025. 

##### [VARIOUS STUDENTS LEAVE THE SPACE]

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Shut the door, please, Ms. Stirling.

##### [A DOOR SWINGS SHUT, ENDING THE SOUND OF PEOPLE DEPARTING]

Thank you. And thank you both for being willing to stay behind for a moment. I wanted to talk to the two of you about- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL (SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE LINE BELOW)

Okay, sir, I don’t think I can be held responsible for what happened in class today, it was a perfectly civil discussion before she jumped in and started getting very personal in her attacks on - my interpretation of the Calador text is fine, thank you very much - and I don’t think that I should be blamed for anything that-

#### AMY STIRLING (SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE LINE ABOVE)

In my defense, I was ready to let what happened today slide until he started making snide little comments about my work being sloppy like it was just the most obvious thing in the - nothing that I said was wrong, and just because someone feels a little threatened by some constructive criticism does not mean-

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Enough. I’m... I’m done with this. I’m done with the two of you hijacking every group discussion, I’m done with the two of you bickering, I’m done with the passive aggressive little asides. The other students hate it, the librarians hate it, and most important of all: I hate it. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL (SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE LINE BELOW)

Sir, we’re just trying to-

#### AMY STIRLING (SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE LINE ABOVE)

I don’t think it’s fair to-

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

D-d-d-d! Did I give either of you permission to speak?

##### [A PAUSE]

I don’t know how this... thing between the two of you started, but I’m done with it. We’re going to get you two to get along, or we’re going to get to the point where one of you kills the other one.

##### [MCCANDLESS OPENS A SUITCASE AND PULLS OUT SOME PAGES]

The Robinson site, down in Princess Elizabeth Land. I’ve gotten the financing for a field work expedition down there come December. You two want to come along? No, no need to talk, just nod if it’s a yes. Okay, good. Here’s the deal. 

##### [HE HOLDS UP A PIECE OF PAPER]

That’s a photograph of a stone carving. They just dug it up before nightfall down there. It’s brand new - virgo intacto. I think when I was your age... translating something like this might have taken me three weeks. You have two. 

##### [AMY AND ADAM BOTH MAKE STARTLED, ALARMED NOISES]

Zip it. Here’s the rules of the game, kids. You get this translated before the time is up, you get to meet the lost Harbinger city up close and personal. Clock runs out and I don’t have a translation that’s at least half as good as mine, you both stay home for Christmas. No half measures, no participation trophies, it’s all our nothing. You either do it or you don’t. Two weeks, starting now. Am I clear?

#### AMY & ADAM

Yes, sir. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Wonderful. I’ll leave you to figure out how you want to work together. 

##### [MCCANDLESS GETS UP, WALKS TO THE DOOR AND OPENS IT]

#### AMY STIRLING

Umm, sir? A question? What if one of us translates this... on our own? Would only that person go to the Robinson Site?

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

If one of you translates this on your own, Ms. Stirling, I will personally pay for the seventy-six trombones for the parade.

##### [BAR CHATTER, ROCK MUSIC PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND]

#### NARRATOR

Four days later. The Silver Barb. Logan Square, Chicago. 

#### AMY STIRLING

I think I might be cursed. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

You’re not cursed. 

#### AMY STIRLING

No, no, hang on. Let’s not dismiss the idea out of hand. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Amy, I’ve met cursed people. I’ve met people who were followed around by pestilence. Your cushy grad school ass with your cushy grad school problems? You’re not cursed. Here.

##### [SHE PUTS A BEER DOWN IN FRONT OF AMY]

#### AMY STIRLING

Okay. One: cheers, thank you for the beer. Two: okay, ouch? I thought we were friends because I could always count on your for a sympathetic ear. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Nah, read the fine print on the contract, Amy. You’re friends with me because I’ll always call you out on your shit, and I’m friends with you because you are an endlessly entertaining hot mess. 

#### AMY STIRLING

I want to revisit the terms of this agreement. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

I’ll have my people reach out to your people. Umm, In the mean time - girl cheers. 

##### [THEY BRING THEIR GLASSES TOGETHER WITH A CLINK]

#### AMY STIRLING

Cheers, thanks, Andie. And, fine, fine, point taken. My life is not exactly a - 

##### [A RECORD SCRATCH]


-------


#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Whoa, whoa, whoa - wait a minute, wait a minute. Did you say... Andie? Your... gal pal who you complain about Adam to... is Andrea Fucking Shepherd? 

#### AMY STIRLING

She was just... Andrea Shepherd, bartender at the time. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

You knew her... when she was Andrea Shepherd, bartender? 

#### AMY STIRLING

I knew her before then, even. I met her when I was sixteen. She did some work with my mother. She was... twenty-one or twenty-two back then. We were just far apart that our lives felt totally separate, but... close enough that we felt like real people to one another. And yeah, I know, I heard how awful that sounded, that is... that’s teenage Amy logic, I guess. But I... I didn’t know a lot of people in Chicago that first year. And she’d moved there when I was still at Princeton. So we hung out a lot while I was in school. Is there a problem? 
 
#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Not... exactly. But, well, suffice it to say, we’re going to come back and… unpack this at a later point. 

#### AMY STIRLING

I salivate at the thought... 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

What happened next? 

##### [THE SOUND OF A TAPE SPOOLING UP]


------


#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Okay, so you gotta do work with a guy you can’t stand. Is it so bad? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh, I don’t know. 

##### [A FAST WHIPPING SOUND, DRUMS THUNDER]


------


#### AMY STIRLING

How can you possibly be this stubborn? Are you going to sit there and tell me - ? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yes, I’m going to - if you take a second and actually look at the thing- 

#### AMY STIRLING

I’ve seen it, Adam, but you are not listening to what I’m telling - ! 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I have listened, okay?! And I know you want _your_ answer to be the right one, but it’s not as-  

#### AMY STIRLING

Okay, none of this is about what I want! It’s about what you- 

##### [ANOTHER FAST WHIP SOUND, THE DRUMS STOP]


------


#### AMY STIRLING

No, wait, I do know. Yes, it is that bad. We haven’t even started the translation. We just get together and yell at one another. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Is it good yelling, at least? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh yeah. Good form, quality decibel count, any day now we’re gonna blow the south wall off the Reynolds Building. 

##### [A PHONE VIBRATES]

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

That you? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Yeah, that’s me. Ahh, speak of the devil and he doth text. “Amy, meet at the fountain in an hour if you’re free.” Oh jeez... 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Okay, allow me to share a thought: why meet with him at all? If you’re just snapping at each other like a pair of - ?

#### AMY STIRLING

Grad students? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Okay, well, I was gonna go with “jackals,” but sure, if you want to use the unflattering term... If neither one of you can do this without the other... what’s the harm in just leaving it alone? 

##### [AMY'S PHONE VIBRATES AGAIN]

#### AMY STIRLING

“Meet at the fountain even if you’re not free. It’s important.” 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

You could just not... 

##### [AMY TAPS ON HER PHONE]

#### AMY STIRLING

I can’t be the one that quits. I can’t be the one that quits first at least. I’m okay with losing, but I can’t lose-lose. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

It’s your blood pressure.

#### AMY STIRLING

Love you too, Andie. See you later. 

##### [TRANSITION SOUND, A COLLEGE CAMPUS, A FOUNTAIN CAN BE HEARD]

#### NARRATOR

An hour later. Sinclair University.
 
#### AMY STIRLING

Adam. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Amy. Thanks for coming.  

#### AMY STIRLING

Yeah. You... wanted to talk? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah. 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### AMY STIRLING

You’re not talking. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I know, just give me a... I’ve been thinking. About... you and me. About us. Because I don’t think we can actually work together on this thing. Not when we’re like this.

#### AMY STIRLING

Like what? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well, for starters, I don’t like you. 

#### AMY STIRLING

I don’t like you, either.  

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Pretty much every word you say, I want to-  

#### AMY STIRLING

Correct? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And every idea that I have, you want to- 

#### AMY STIRLING

Refute? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And even when you do make a good point, some part of me wants to- 

#### AMY STIRLING

Argue with it? Yeah, okay, I take your point. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

So... I think we need to do something drastic. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Drastic? Drastic like what? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well, two options come to mind. Option one is... we commit. I hate you, you hate me. We circle around one another, we growl, snap at each other. Sooner or later, one of us wins and the other... I don’t know, transfers to UCLA. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Fuck, that’s bleak. What’s the alternative? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...have a drink with me tonight? 

#### AMY STIRLING

What? What did you just- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You know, you, me, a drink- 

#### AMY STIRLING

What, like, a drink of cyanide or- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What? No, Jesus, Amy. A drink of beer, or wine, or whiskey, or I don’t know, whatever. 

#### AMY STIRLING

No, beer is fine, but- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I was thinking maybe the Broken Quarter around eight if- 

#### AMY STIRLING

What in all the fuck is happening right now? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What do think is hap - ? A date, I’m asking if you would like to go on a date. With me. Tonight. 

#### AMY STIRLING

But - you dislike me. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

That’s not what I said. 

#### AMY STIRLING

What did you say? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I said I don’t like you. So that might mean that I dislike you or... it might mean the other thing. You want to find out which one it is? 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### AMY STIRLING

This is a very stupid idea. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...that’s not a no. 

#### AMY STIRLING

I really think this is stupid. It’s stupid and ridiculous.  

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...that’s still not a no.

#### AMY STIRLING

Like, we’re just going to have a drink and then that’s supposed to make everything else just - ?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Amy. Are you saying no? 

#### AMY STIRLING

...I think I’m not saying no, no. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay. So you wanna say... nine? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Yeah, nine... works. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Cool, cool. 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### AMY STIRLING (SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE LINE BELOW)

Well, I gotta get going to do some stuff so, uh, bye!

#### ADAM BLACKWELL (SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE LINE ABOVE)

Yeah, I’ve gotta get to a thing, but see you later!

##### [FOOTSTEPS DEPART IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS]


------


#### AMY STIRLING

The thing is... it was a stupid idea, and nothing came of it. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

What happened? During the date itself? What went wrong?

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh, come on. I’m sure that Adam already told you _all_ about it. Do you need me to take you through all of it again? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Is there a reason you don’t - ?

#### AMY STIRLING

Because it’s embarrassing, okay? All of this stuff is... It’s so ancient history. All of it. The idea that it might matter to what happened in Boston is just... 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Well, I hate to be the one to break it to you, but it does matter. It matters because it’s you and it’s him, and it’s the two of you together, and the two of you are right at the heart of the matter. So... indulge me. April 24th, 2025. What happened? 

##### [TRANSITION SOUND]


------


##### [BAR CHATTER, ROCK MUSIC PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND]

#### NARRATOR

Sinclair University. 2025. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, okay, your turn... tell me something interesting. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Right, uh, sure... umm... did you know that right now there are seven people who could save the world?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Seven people who - what? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Seven people, right now, on this planet. All of whom could save the world.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And not like... people who could press a “launch the nukes” button and are refraining from it, thus-  

#### AMY STIRLING

No, no, fuck that. That sucks.

##### [THEY BOTH LAUGH A BIT AT THAT]

I’m talking active, “making things that are broken not be broken” saving the world. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, consider me intrigued. Who are these magnificent seven? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Paul Berthold, Makoto Kamiki, Simon Godowksi, Jerome Eckerberg, Jacqueline Saint-Pierre, Carlos Luis Méndez, and Zakir Mujambar. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

The world’s six richest men and its richest woman. I see. How do they save the world, though?

#### AMY STIRLING

Well, for example, Simon Godowski has a net worth of two-hundred and ten billion. NGO’s estimate that the yearly cost of ending world hunger would be-  

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

—two hundred billion?

#### AMY STIRLING

Nope. Your guess is way high. Conservative estimate? Ten billion a year. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Wait, seriously?  

#### AMY STIRLING

Other stuff’s even cheaper. The threshold for extreme poverty’s set at those living for three dollars and twenty cents a day. Bumping about nine hundred million people up to that level costs about one-point-eight billion. Eckerberg’s got that in his glove compartment. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Holy shit.  

#### AMY STIRLING

I know. Umm, let’s see... I think  clean water across the world’s about fifty billion. Child health’s about four-hundred dollars a year per child... call that another fifty billion, give or take. Homelessness is actually really tough, but something like thirteen billion would end homelessness in San Francisco. Which, okay, now we’ve kind of gotten away from “saving the world” but- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

—still very much worth doing. Which does kind of beg the question...

#### AMY STIRLING

...if there are people who have the ability to just snap their fingers and save the world, why is the world not saved? I don’t fucking know! I mean, do you have any guesses?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well, I mean... I mean, cash flow, maybe? Like, just because Jacqueline Saint-Pierre has a net worth of two hundred billion, it doesn’t mean she has it sitting in a bank somewhere. It’s in, like, stocks and bonds and company valuation. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Okay, sure, _fine_, but that feels like a surmountable problem. If you have something worth fifty billion, theoretically you should be able to sell it and then you have fifty billion, yeah? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I’m sort of scared to disagree with you right now. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Good, that means my whole shtick is doing its job. 

##### [THEY BOTH LAUGH A BIT]

I don’t know, man. If I had that much power, and if there was as much broken in the world as there is today, I think I’d feel a, like, moral imperative to do something about it.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay. I’m sold. Let’s each the rich. 

#### AMY STIRLING

That’s not what I’m- 
 
#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, let’s do it. Just the seven richest, though. No need to be greedy. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Okay, sure. Let’s eat those seven people and feed the world. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

How do you know all of this stuff off the top of your head? 

#### AMY STIRLING

I like actuarial tables and I have a good head for numbers. Even when I’m outraged. No, especially when I’m outraged. You’d think you’d know that by now.  

##### [ADAM MAKES A "THAT'S FAIR" SOUND, THEN THEY BOTH LAUGH]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

So... we’ve had a drink. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Three by my count. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And... now what happens? 

##### [AMY TAKES A SWIG OF HER BEER]

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh, I don’t know. How... would you feel... about walking me home?

##### [ADAM SNORTS A BIT INTO HIS BEER]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I’d feel okay about that.  

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh, that was easy. I didn’t even need to do that thing where I make my eyes all big and round. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Hey, I will have you know that I am immune to the thing where you make your eyes all big and round.

#### AMY STIRLING

Nobody’s immune to the thing. It’s like a superpower. I’m basically an X-Men villain. 

##### [THEY BOTH LAUGH A BIT AT THAT]

Before we call it a night and call this a successful date... tell me. You had a thought a moment ago. About why people aren’t saving the world. I saw you bite down on something, what was it?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, it’s- 

#### AMY STIRLING

Come on tell me. I want to know. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well... how much would it cost to, say, fix climate change? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh. I dunno. Seven hundred billion a year? Something like that?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, so if I wanted to solve climate change, but I’ve only got a measly two hundred billion in my bank account... Wouldn’t the most productive thing I could do with that money be to... well, turn it into seven hundred billion? 

#### AMY STIRLING

I... I mean, not really? Like the only way to accumulate that much capital would probably be through means that release more carbon into the atmosphere and- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, but if there was a way to do it without- 

#### AMY STIRLING

I mean, even in theory it’s a little messy-

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

But let’s say that there was a way- 

#### AMY STIRLING

Well, academically it could be interesting, but-  

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Just as a thought experiment - indulge me. 
 
#### AMY STIRLING

Okay, fine, you’re indulged. But what are you saying?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I’m saying that since no one person can actually stop the world from ending, we should- 

#### AMY STIRLING

Wait, what? No, no, the whole point I’m making is that someone _could_ save- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, someone like a Fritz Haber, maybe, but in reality- 

#### AMY STIRLING

I think we’re getting away from the point, and-  

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, look, it’s just a matt-

#### AMY STIRLING

Wait, Adam, hang on, can I just - ? I don’t think it’s responsible. That’s all. To just... hoard money and power under the auspices of, “Maybe some day we’ll have enough to actually make a difference.” If you can make a difference today, isn’t it better to make a difference today? Like, I know you can be a little obtuse, but you’re also annoyingly brilliant, so you have to at least be able to see it from that perspective, right?

##### [A PAUSE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay. It’s, uh, it’s getting a little late. Maybe... maybe we should call it a night. 

##### [ADAM GETS UP FROM HIS CHAIR]

#### AMY STIRLING

Adam- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Obtuse? I’m _obtuse_? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Okay, like three words after that I called you brilliant. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And annoying. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Annoyingly brilliant! There’s a difference! Which you’d know if you ever actually listened to what’s coming out of my mouth! 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Sorry, Amy. You know, sometimes it’s just... I’m trying to keep track of the big picture. Okay? Sorry if that’s too obtuse or annoying of me for you.

#### AMY STIRLING

No, it’s - it’s not, Adam. It really isn’t. But you... you’re so worried about getting something wrong that... God, I just want you to take a swing at something - at anything! Just so I know there’s a real person somewhere in there. 

##### [ADAM LETS OUT A BARK OF DRY LAUGHTER]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You know, it’s funny. I thought that’s what I was doing tonight. But... you can’t get it right every time, I suppose. Good night, Amy. See you later.

And then he left. And that was pretty much it. We had some fun arguing. And then we... didn’t have fun arguing. End of the story. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And after the date? What happened then? 

##### [TRANSITION SOUND]
##### [THE DOOR BANGS OPEN AGGRESSIVELY AS AMY ENTERS]

#### AMY STIRLING

I am done with men. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

...everything okay, champ?  

#### AMY STIRLING

I am done with men, I am done listening to men and their stupid men ideas. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

What happened? Amy, what happened? 

#### AMY STIRLING

GUH, I don’t even know. Adam said that we should get together and have a drink. And so we... got together. We had drinks. We were talking. It was nice. I was looking cute. And then... And then we were snapping and fighting and he said a thing and I said a thing and it was just... what it always is with us. Oh god, I think I said he was obtuse and annoying. Who does that? Who is like, “There you go, always being so annoying and obtuse.” God...

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

You’re one of a kind, Amy. So now what? 

##### [ANDREA GIVES AMY A BEER]

#### AMY STIRLING

I don’t know. I resign myself to fighting with him from now until forever. Oh god, or maybe I do transfer to UCLA. Then I’d really be cursed. Okay, Andie, what is that face? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Amy... look, I know it’s verboten in our adult friendship to bring up anything about when you were sixteen...

#### AMY STIRLING

You are on _such_ thin ice right now. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

But... permission to speak freely? Thank you. You remember those three weeks that you were totally obsessed with Joshua Petersen? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Who? ...yes, okay, I remember the weeks in question.  

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Okay. And after that, you were going out with that Evan guy for a hot minute... and then Charlie. You’d talk about them non-stop and then one day... Nothing. What happened with them?

#### AMY STIRLING

I don’t know. I was sixteen and kind of awful. 

##### [ANDREA LAUGHS]

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Girl, you’re still kind of awful. That hasn’t changed.  

#### AMY STIRLING

I know, shut up. Those guys were... fun. For a bit. And but then... I got bored, I guess. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Okay then. Well you have complained about Adam Blackwell... every single time that I have seen you... for nine months. And that is about eight months longer than any boy has ever held your attention before. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Sorry, what are you saying? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

I’m saying... you fought, and you insulted one another, and you snapped at each other like little yappy dogs. But... were you bored?

#### AMY STIRLING

We practically tore each other apart, Andie. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Were you bored? 

#### AMY STIRLING

I - I think by the end we were insulting each others’ life philosophy! 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Amelia! Were - you - bored?  

##### [A PAUSE]

#### AMY STIRLING

No. I had a great time. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Of course you did, you big fucking weirdo. Oh my god. Because you have been waiting for someone to come along that you could have a nice, big shout-at-each-other-until-you’re-red-in-the-face argument with. And I think you wouldn’t be so hung up on all of this if... well, if you didn’t really like him on some level. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Don’t make fun of me. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

I would never in a million years.

#### AMY STIRLING

God, you know me so well. Amy Stirling, whose love language is a shouting match at a bar. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Yeah. But here’s the million dollar question: does he know that?

#### AMY STIRLING

I... fuck. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Yeah, that’s what I’m saying. 

#### AMY STIRLING

I gotta go. 

##### [AMY GETS TO HER FEET, RUNS OFF, RUNS BACK]

I love you, thank you, bye. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Bye.

#### NARRATOR

Sinclair University Seminar Room. An hour later. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Adam! There you - sorry, uh, hi. Do you have a moment? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I’m actually- 

#### AMY STIRLING

This’ll just take a minute. I just - I was thinking after last night and- I just needed to say that- 

##### [A DOOR OPENS, FOOTSTEPS AS MCCANDLESS ENTERS, SHUTTING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM, HE FLIPS THROUGH SOME PAGES]

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Well, well, Mr. Blackwell. I just had a chance to go over it. Congratulations. This is outstanding work. Well done. I’ll be thrilled to have you along for the expedition in December. 

##### [HE SHAKES ADAM'S HAND]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Thank you, sir. It’ll be an honor. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Ah... Ms. Stirling. I’m... sorry to say I was wrong. Looks like it was possible for someone to crack that assignment on their own. There’ll be other opportunities, I promise. Better luck next time

##### [FOOTSTEPS, A DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING AS MCCANDLESS EXITS]

#### AMY STIRLING

Adam... what did you do? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

After I left the bar last night, I just... I couldn’t sleep. So I... took a swing at it. And something just clicked. I guess I just... needed to take a chance on it. (A pause.) I committed. That’s what I did. But sorry, you were going to say something. 

#### AMY STIRLING

I... I just wanted to say... fuck you, Adam Blackwell. You’re such an asshole.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER _[echoing, distant]_ Ms. Stirling? Ms. Stirling?

##### [AMY STIRS IN HER CHAIR]

#### AMY STIRLING

I’m... I’m sorry. What was the question? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

I was just asking what happened next? After the date? 

#### AMY STIRLING

...nothing. From that point on, Adam and I were enemies. We couldn’t stand one another. He got to go with McCandless, I didn’t. Things soured for me at Sinclair after that. Eventually... I went to look for greener pastures. 

##### [A PHONE VIBRATES AS IT GETS AN INCOMING CALL]

Oh, sorry - do you mind if I - ? It’ll be fast. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Please, go ahead. 

##### [AMY ANSWERS THE PHONE, WHICH STOPS VIBRATING]

#### AMY STIRLING

Hey. No, I’m still here with the lawyer. We’re still... trying to see if we can clean up Adam’s mess.

##### [A PAUSE]

Well, you’re sweet for calling. It’s nice to hear your voice.

##### [A PAUSE]

I know, I know... not exactly what you expected when we got married, was it?

##### [A PAUSE]

You still think I’m devastatingly pretty, though, right?

##### [A PAUSE]

Okay, good boy. Look, I... I should get back to it. But thanks for calling. I... I love you, too. Bye. 

##### [AMY HANGS UP, A PAUSE, SHE EXHALES AS SHE SETTLES BACK INTO HER CHAIR]

#### AMY STIRLING

All right, Ms. Skinner. What’s next? 

##### [CLOSING THEME MUSIC BEGINS]

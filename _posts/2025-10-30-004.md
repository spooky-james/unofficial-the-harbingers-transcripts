summary:         "When Amy Stirling met Adam Blackwell, it was pretty much hate at first sight. From the earliest days of their relationship, the two of them were bitter rivals and ideological opposites. But did it always have to be this way? In those early days, was there ever a chance for something more between the man and the woman who would forever change the course of history?"

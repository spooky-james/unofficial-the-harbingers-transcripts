##### [STATELY CHAMBER MUSIC PLAYS]

#### NARRATOR

Sinclair University. October, 2018. 

##### [A DOOR OPENS, THEN CLOSES, FOOTSTEPS APPROACH]

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Eria aldro syrandel. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I’m - I’m sorry? Sir? 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Eria aldro syrandel.

##### [MACCANDLESS PRESSES A BUTTON WHICH STOPS THE MUSIC]

What do you think? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I... think you might be talking to the wrong person, sir.

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Oh? 

##### [MCCANDLESS PICKS UP A PIECE OF PAPER]

You’re Adam Blackwell?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yes. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Second year transfer from Oregon State, Adam Blackwell? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yes. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

You’re in my office right now because I told someone “Go get me Adam Blackwell who transferred from Oregon State” and you’re the person they went and got me? You’re that Adam Blackwell. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yes, but— 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

I’m not talking to the wrong person.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Professor McCandless, I- 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Sit down.

##### [ADAM SITS DOWN]

You’re not in my class, Mr. Blackwell. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Adam’s fine, sir. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

You’re not in my class, Mr. Adam. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Just Adam is - No, sir, I’m not. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Why not? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You, uhhh, you wouldn’t let me. I tried to add it to my schedule during shopping period, but- 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

The university cares about average class size. If I let more than seventy-five people enroll in the intro class, they get cranky. When they get cranky, they don’t pay for my trips to active archeological sites. You understand. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Abso - absolutely. Yes, I get that. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

We teach the intro class every semester. It’ll be there for you in four months.

##### [A PAUSE]

You seem unsatisfied. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well... with all due respect, sir, you don’t teach the intro class every semester. And with all due respect to your colleagues, when the other professors in the anthropology department teach it, it’s not a seventy-five person class. From what I understand, when it’s not you teaching it, sometimes it isn’t even a ten person class. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Which is why you’ve been sneaking into my lectures. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I - I can explain that.

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Even though I said no auditors.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I didn’t think that - I’ve just dropped in from time to time to hear the lectures, I didn’t think- 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Eria aldro syrandel. What does it mean?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I... I think it’s... “all things have an... image?”

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

“All things have a reflection,” actually. But not bad. That was carved on something called the Childers Column. Do you know what that is? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No. Yes, I know what the Childers Column is. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

You have not just been sitting in on my classes. You’ve been doing the reading. You’ve been doing the extra credit reading. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Sir, how could you know - ? 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

About ten percent of the class I teach is in a dead language. You get good at seeing who is waiting for you to stop saying weird old words that mean nothing to no one, and who... understands. And then you get good at noticing which of the people who understand aren’t in the class registry. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, I’m sorry. I just- 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

You’re already taking five classes. 

##### [MCCANDLESS FLIPS A PAGE]

Intro to linguistics and semiotics, early medieval history, a seminar on English literature, a historiography class, statistics... that’s more than a full load.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Not all of my credits from Portland State transferred.

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

And you’re still finding time to crash my lectures three times a week and get passably good at a dead language? 

##### [A PAUSE, A BOOK LANDS ON THE DESK WITH A FLUMPH]

That’s for you. Call it an audition. I want two thousand words on the original translation of the Childers Column, and I want it by Friday at six. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

But - sir, this - I don’t know if- 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

That’s Roser and Langholtz, the best guide we have to the Harbinger languages. That’s my personal copy too, with my annotations, so I’ll want that back at the end of the semester. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

At - at the end of the semester? 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

I’ll meet you here every Monday at six, and I’ll have some work for you to do. You’ll get it to me by six on Friday. If you are late one time, we are done. If you half-ass your work one time, we are done. If you half-ass your work in other classes, if you don’t end the semester with at least a three-point-eight, we are done. But get to December without disappointing me... and I’ll make sure you are in every class I teach for the rest of your time at Sinclair. Do we have a deal? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Y-yes! Sir that would be - I can’t tell you - it would mean so much to - I really appreciate you taking a- 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Yes, yes, very good. While I’m sure those sentence fragments are going to lovely places, why don’t we just leave it at this: Professor Julian McCandless. 

##### [THEY SHAKE HANDS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Adam. Adam Blackwell, sir. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

It’s a pleasure to meet you, Adam Blackwell. I think we’re going to do some great work together.

##### [A CLOCK TICKS, SKINNER FLIPS THROUGH PAGES AS SHE SPEAKS] 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Tell me about... Julian McCandless. Your mentor, the person who first taught you about the Harbingers. What is he like?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, he’s like... five foot ten, five foot eleven? Thereabouts? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Dr. Blackwell... 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

He’s the Andrew Jolliet Professor of Archeology and Anthropology at Sinclair University, a position they literally invented just so they could give it to him. He got a doctorate at twenty-seven, and tenure at thirty-two. He has, in his lifetime, completely changed our understanding of how the Harbinger languages work, and he’s only fifty. Nobody in the world knows more about the Harbingers than he does. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Nobody except you, of course. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Nobody. Professor McCandless knows a lot more than I ever will. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Adam, do you have a doctorate from Sinclair University? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I do.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Do you have a Harbinger ring that lets you do magic? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Sure, and—

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Did you use said magical powers to teleport the city of Boston to the moon? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I did, but—

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Great. If you would like to get through what’s about to happen in one piece, do me a favor and never fucking say that there’s someone out there that might know more about this stuff than you do, _understood_?

##### [A PAUSE, ADAM TAKES A SHAKY BREATH]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

There’s a difference between what I can do and what he does. That’s all I’m saying. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

You became his student in... 2018? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

My first year at Sinclair, back when I was an undergrad. He took me under his wing. I took five classes with him before I graduated. Then, three years later, I went back and became one of his grad students. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And when did he start having an undue amount of influence over you?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Who said he had an undue amount of influence over me?

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Good boy. I’m gonna start to throw curveballs like that your way every now and then. No, here’s the real question: In an interview from 2028, you claimed that your time studying under Professor McCandless was the most influential in your life. That before you took a class with him, you weren’t interested in anthropology or archeology or Harbinger culture. If he’d been teaching a class on chemistry, you’d now be a chemist. You said this is the man who set you down the path of what has become your life. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I was promised something about a real question somewhere in here...? 
 
#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Yes, and here it is: does the Andrew Jolliet Professor of Archeology and Anthropology at Sinclair University wield an undue amount of influence over the most powerful man in the world? Put it another way: if this man told you to jump off a bridge, would you do it? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Or if this man told me to teleport a whole city into outer space, would I do it? I don’t know. He hasn’t ever done either of those things. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

But he _did_ tell you to follow him to one of the remotest, most dangerous parts of the world, which you did. And to enter an ancient tomb, which you did. And to- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yes, fine, point made. I don’t know what to tell you. He... was smart. And he knew how to teach in a way that... invited you to come up to his level. So many of my college professors made me feel like I was an ant next to them. Professor McCandless could explain something in a way that made you feel like you could rise up to where he was. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Next slide please... 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

His lectures were... a joy to listen to. 

##### [TRANSITION SOUND]

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Okay, now this is what we in the business affectionately call the Chamber of the Seven Devils.

#### NARRATOR

Sinclair University. October, 2018. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

That is not it’s official name, of course, but I find it a bit catchier than Room A14 of the Lancaster Site. They found this place in the  Kerguelen Islands, more commonly known by their slightly dramatic nickname of the Desolation Islands. If neither of those names ring a bell, it’s a small archipelago found in the way, way southern part of the Indian Ocean. The islands are considered one of the most isolated places on Earth, so, you know, book your next vacation now. 

##### [SOME LAUGHTER FROM HIS STUDENTS]

All kidding aside, this is actually the first Harbinger site that was ever discovered, all the way back in 1778. It’s also the only extant structure we’ve ever found outside of the Antarctic continent itself. And until very recently, when we actually started discovering the ones in the Antarctic continent itself, it was more or less all we had in terms of Harbinger sites. So, you know, weirdos like me have spent about two-hundred years really picking this place apart. 

##### [A BIT MORE LAUGHTER FROM HIS STUDENTS]

Now, you’ve probably noticed a couple of interesting things about this building. For starters, it’s startlingly well preserved for a building that’s approximately six thousand years old. Part of this is due to the fact that this was actually the lower level of a temple complex. Half of it was built above ground, with a mirror image below ground. Back in the seventies, when the brutalists got obsessed with the idea, they called it iceberg architecture. But as with so many things, the Harbingers did it first. Next slide, please. As above, so below. That’s what the old alchemists used to say. Harbingers called it “The Law of Correspondence.” Eria aldro syrandel. All things have a reflection. To every action an equal, opposite reaction - a little preview of Newton they gave the world all the way back in the 4,000’s B.C. As you can see here in this conceptual reconstruction of what the full complex would have looked like... the Harbingers lived this principle through and through. Everything they built, that we’ve found at least, seems to have been put together in the iceberg style. That’s what saved this particular site - the elements ate away at the top layer, but the bottom one stayed relatively well preserved. Next slide, thank you. 

##### [THE CLICK OF A SLIDE PROJECTOR]

Now, the next interesting thing you might have noticed is this room is actually a perfect heptagon - or it would have been when it was in pristine conditions, anyway. It’s a big, big room with seven corners in it. And in each of those... a statue. Most of them were too worn down by the time we found them, but - next slide - these two you can see a remarkable amount of detail on. Chamber of the seven devils. Seven is a big, talismanically important number in Harbinger studies - it crops up all the time. So be on the lookout for it. These are devils number four and number six. Erodeo and Saelix. And the room above would have been the room of angels, with seven more statues. Again: mirrors, reflection, above and below. Next image, please. 

##### [ANOTHER CLICK FROM THE SLIDE PROJECTOR]

That’s too Judeo-Christian of a name, by the way. I want to acknowledge that. If we’re going for as a literal a translation as we can, it should be something like... the chamber of guardians and the chamber of challengers, but the place was rediscovered by French explorers so... 

##### [MACCANDLESS SCOFFS]

If the Harbingers had a concept of gods, we haven’t found much about them yet. But we’ve found a lot of records about their concept of the seven angels and a lot a lot about the seven devils. Lots of different fables and allegories, chiseled into stone beneath the ice. Most of them talk about them as these... forces. Trying to reshape the world. And if they came to you, they could give you power. The power to change the world. The trick, of course, was to ask yourself... Am I changing it into what I want it to be? Or into what they want it to be? Thank you, Elodie, you can - you can shut that off, now. 

##### [THE SLIDE PROJECTOR IS TURNED OFF WITH A CLICK]

And we can get the lights up too. Umm... so this is usually the point in the class where someone goes... you know, who cares? Who cares? Some very old people lived on some very old rocks and they had ideas about things like angels and devils and powers and so what. Who cares? Maybe you don’t. And... for certain people, nothing I could say could change that. But for me? Here’s why we should care: To study a culture’s religion is to study that culture’s notion of the ideal human being. Sometimes only subconsciously, but still. When we call something a god, what we’re saying is “This is what, as a culture we are going to try to be. This is what we’re aiming for.” Christianity is a religion where an all-powerful man is always right. And, well, we’ve gotten pretty patriarchal in most places where the majority ticks Christian on the census form. The ancient Greek pantheon were a big, squabbling family who had to work together to get things done. Even when they hated one another, which was a lot of the time. They were one of the first places to try out this crazy idea called democracy. We act like our gods. But with the Harbingers... you have a mythology where the divine beings from a higher plane of existence are not all-powerful. Where they can only affect the world when we open the door for them to do so. So if we act like our gods... what does a concept of spirituality based on... cooperation do to a society? In a world where god depends on man to act upon reality... what does the ideal man look like? 

##### [A PAUSE]

Okay, that’s... that’s enough heady stuff for one day. Does anyone have any questions? 

##### [SOME HANDS GO UP]


------


#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

You don’t actually think of yourself as a god, do you? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

That’s - that’s not the point. In the Western World, we think of a god as someone that creates out of nothing. He snaps his fingers and the world changes. How would our way of interacting with the world change if our concept of the divine was of a being that... What?

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Doctor Blackwell... Look, in my profession, there is a subtle but important distinction between a right answer and a _correct_ answer. A right answer is factual, but not always _appropriate_, do you understand? Good. The next time anyone asks you if you think of yourself as a god, the correct answer is _no, for fuck’s sake!_

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, that is not- 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

I mean, seriously- 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER (SIIMULTANEOUS WITH THE BELOW)

—I need you to actually hear the words that come out of your mouth, because while you pontificate about sociology and theoretical geopolitics the whole world is terrified of what you are going to do next because need I remind you that—

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER (SIIMULTANEOUS WITH THE ABOVE)

—I am trying to make a larger point about cultural anthropology, about the way that we reckon with spirituality and how it comes to shape our thoughts and you are just trying to make it into - what? An ego thing? Because that is not—

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

—half a million people are dead? 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Six hundred thousand. Just... for the record. From what I understand, the estimate is that there where six hundred and forty-five thousand, seven-hundred and seventy-seven people in... in Boston that day. So no. You don’t need to remind me. 

##### [A PAUSE, SKINNER LETS OUT A LOW BREATH]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

I’m... Sorry. That was not... my most sensitive. Would you like to take a break? We’ve been... at this for some time. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I’m fine to keep going. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Okay. Suffice to say... McCandless is an important figure in your life? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Suffice to under-say. I would have followed him to the ends of the Earth. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

You _did_ follow him to the ends of the Earth. Tell me about the Robinson Site. 

##### [ADAM CHUCKLES A BIT]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It’s... it’s hard to describe. 

##### [THE STEADY CLOCK OF THE OFFICE IS REPLEACED BY THE HOWLING WINDS OF AN ANTARCTIC WASTELAND]

Have you ever been? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

To Antarctica? Can’t say that I have. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It’s not as remote as it once was, since what happened. Tourism’s gone way up, mostly amateur archeologists and Harbinger groupies, hoping to catch a glimpse of the world that came before. But that’s now. Back then? When I first went? It was just... endless. White that went on forever. As far as you can see, with just the occasional rocky outcropping or nunatak to break up the great expanse. If you go during the half of the year when it’s day, the sky and the ground reflect each other like a perfect mirror. If you go during the half of the year when it’s night, you get to freeze in the blackest dark that anyone will ever see. 

##### [A PAUSE, THE WIND BLOWS]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

What was that word? A _noon-talk_? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

_Nunatak._ Greenlandic term. It means a point where the top of a mountain pokes out from under ice or snow. It’s the sort of thing that happens down there. You go, “That’s a rock.” No, that’s a mountain. A mountain that’s been buried. And that’s when you understand just how much snow you’re standing on top of. Of course, we’ve changed that. Climate change means a lot of that has melted away. The mountain ranges of Antarctica are actually looking like mountains these days. Which is how we found it. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

_An_-Serith. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

_[correcting her pronunciation]_ An-Serith. The great lost city of the Harbingers. Buried for millennia beneath a hundred and twenty meters of ice. Well, what was left of it, anyway. Discovered by French-Australian archeologist Hélène Robinson in the late nineties. It had taken over twenty years of excavating to reach the lowest chambers. Eight months before I got there, they’d broken through a big stone slab - found a shaft that seemed to go all the way to the bottom. It’s why McCandless was so excited to get out there that year. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

How is it possible for an ancient city, even one that’s half-built underground, to have been created on a continent where the average winter temperature is minus fifty degrees? How did they survive? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, early theories were architectural. Great convection systems built right into the foundation of the building structures, able to keep the city as a whole habitable during the dark part of the year. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

What’s the modern theory? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

A wizard did it. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Hmmph. Fair enough. That’s where it happened? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah. The third day after I got to Antarctica. My first day down in the crypts. That’s where it happened. 


------


##### [THE WIND FADES AWAY, THE ELECTRIC WHINE OF A LIFT]

#### NARRATOR

Robinson Archeological Site. The ruins of An-Serith. November, 2025. 

##### [THE LIFT REACHES THE BOTTOM, IT OPENS AS SOMEONE STEPS OFF OF IT]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh my god... oh my god... 

##### [A CHIRP OF WALKIE-TALKIE, MCCANDLESS' VOICE SPEAKS THROUGH, THE WALKIE-TALKIES KEEP MAKING CHIRPING NOISES AS THEY ALTERNATE WHO IS SPEAKING]

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Blackwell, you doing okay down there? You make it to the bottom? Over. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Professor. Yeah, I’m all the way at the bottom. I’m off the lift. Over. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Okay, step back. We’re sending it back up for the next person. Over. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Copy that, I’m all clear. Over. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

What’s it look like, kid? What are you seeing? Over. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It’s... beyond words. It’s one thing to see pictures, but to actually be here... Over. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

You are breathing the air of the Harbingers now. Over. 

##### [ADAM LAUGHS A A BIT AT THAT — WHAT A WILD THOUGHT!]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

The walls, they... they actually sparkle. Over. 

##### [OVER ADAM, THERE APPEARS TO BE A DISTANT BANGING SOUND]

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Yeah. That’s the sapphire. We still don’t know how the hell they were working it like that six thousand years ago. Or how the hell they got it down here. But it’s incredible to see it, isn’t it? Over. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah. The chamber’s big, too. Bigger than I expected. Must be at least... what? Twenty-five feet, end to end? 

##### [ANOTHER BANG, MORE PRONOUNCED]

Umm, over. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

I think that’s about right, yeah. You see it yet? The sarcophagus? Over. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Umm, I... yeah. I think so. 

##### [A PAUSE AS HE MOVES THROUGH THE SPACE]

Okay, I’m next to it now. Erun caler Sarkor der... here lies Sarkor, first son.

##### [ANOTHER DISTANT BANG OVER HIM]

We still have no idea who this is? Over.

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

That’s what I brought you out here for. Fresh eyes on the problem. Over. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah... _Celrun Silambar._ That’s what it says here. That’s... what? The Distant One? Yeah? Over.

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Either that or The One Who Travels Distances, yeah. The current best guess from the linguistics is that he was some kind of traveler or diplomat, but we haven’t seen anything that would back up the claim that - 

##### [THE LOUDEST BANG YET, THIS TIME ACCOMPANIED BY THE SOUND OF SHIFTING ROCK AND BREAKING METAL]

Oh holy - Adam, LOOK OUT! 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What? What is - ? 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Get clear, get away from the - !

##### [A HORRIBLE CRASHING SOUND FOLLOWED BY A LONG MOMENT OF SILENCE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

For a moment? I really thought I’d died. But just for a moment. 

##### [A CHIRP FROM THE WALKIE-TALKIE]

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Adam? Adam, are you there? Come in, Adam! 


------


#### ADAM BLACKWELL

The good news is I wasn’t dead. The bad new is that cable on the lift they’d used to lower me into the site had snapped. The lift had fallen, crashing into the sides of the shaft as it went, dislodging a couple thousand pounds of icy sediment as it fell a hundred and twenty meters. 

##### [THE GHOSTLY ECHO OF THE FALLING LIFT COLLIDES AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE TUNNEL]

So you know, kind of a mixed day for me. Oh, and I’d also sprained my ankle. Fine, let’s call it a bad day. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

How long were you down there? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Two days. Little more, but basically... two days. Most of it in the dark, in total silence. I’d use my flashlight a bit, I’d talk to Professor McCandless and hear about how they were scrambling to get me out of there. But I knew I needed to conserve the power. So a lot of it was just... very dark. And very quiet. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

How did you keep it together?

##### [ADAM LAUGHS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, I very much did not keep it together. I was... in a tomb. Beneath a football field of snow. Barely any food, barely any water, a dead body all around me. Yeah. The falling debris that came into the room, a piece of it had hit the sarcophagus, smashed it apart. Whoever Sarkor, Distant First Son was, now bits of his very old remains were all around me. I was... practically breathing him. So yeah. I did not keep it together. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And that’s when you found it? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah. That’s when I found it. 

##### [A DRONE AS THE SCENE FADES BACK TO THE ANTARCTIC TOMB, ADAM SHIVERS IN THE COLD]

I hadn’t moved much. What with my leg and the... dead body of it all. Which is how I hadn’t seen it. It must have been in the sarcophagus, too. Just sitting down there... all this time. A silver ring.

##### [A STRANGE WHOOSH GOES THROUGH THE AIR]

A silver ring that had been down there for the better part of all of human history. 

##### [ADAM REMOVES HIS GLOVE]

Tell me... is it good archeological practice to just… put on a six-thousand year old ring from an active digsite? 

##### [ADAM SHIVERS VIOLENTLY]

But I... I thought I was going to die. This was a tomb and I was going to die here. Might as well become part of the history of the place. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And what happened? When you put it on? 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Does anyone have any questions? How about the class stowaway? Mr. Blackwell? 

##### [WE HEAR MCCANDLESS AND ADAM FROM AN EARLIER SCENE WITH THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE TOMB, THE TWO SCENES BLEND TOGETHER]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Professor, what does contact with these... devils look like? What does the Harbinger tradition say about what meeting one of these beings was like?

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

A good question. Well, it depends on which account you’re looking at - uhh, different carvings depict different things. But overwhelmingly, they describe it as... an explosion. 

##### [THERE'S A SHARP RINGING IN THE AIR, A LOW SOUND BUILDS UP]

An explosion of the mind. 

##### [A BOOM, STRANGE DISTORTED SOUNDS]

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Some of the fables and allegories speak of the communion with these old powers as a kind of... moment of clarity. A point of delirious, feverish revelation. Where for one instant, you could see everything that came before you, and everything that’s coming after. 

##### [VOICES, SOUNDS, LOCATIONS ALL BLEND TOGETHER, GOING TOO FAST AND TOO DISTORTED TO BE COMPREHENSIBLE]

It’s the kind of thing that could drive people mad. But for those who weren’t broken... sometimes they would return with knowledge. Divine knowledge, or knowledge of a lost age, lost in the ashes of history. 

##### [A BEATING HEART STARTS TO POUND]

That’s what... the stories say anyway. But... who knows.

##### [THE HEARTBEAT GROWS LOUDER, FASTER]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What was it like, to put on the ring? 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Who knows what making contact with a power like the ones the Harbingers myths describe would actually be like...

##### [THE DISTORTED SOUNDS FADE AWAY, LEAVING ADAM'S HEAVY BREATH AND HEARTBEAT, UNDERNEATH IT A DRONE BUILDS UP]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It was pretty much the most terrifying thing that ever happened to me. And when it was over... I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think. I just... I needed to get out of there. I was just staring at the pile of debris and ice that was blocking the shaft that led back to the outside world. And all I could think of was... “I want this ice to be gone. I want this ice to be gone.” And so I just... screamed it. Those exact words.

They called it a miracle. A beautiful miracle. Nobody thought they’d be able to dig me out in time. It was way too much ice. No way. But... I got out. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And... when did it become clear that you could do magic?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Not for a bit. I spent most of the following week unconscious. Another one drinking grandma’s chicken noodle soup at Davis Station. But... eventually people started asking questions. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Why did they start to ask questions? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Because twenty days after I got out, someone found approximately two-thousand pounds of icy debris and shattered mineshaft lift in the middle of nowhere, about seventy miles to the West of the Robinson Site. And nobody knew how it got there. Turns out a wizard did it.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

That word you just said... a miracle. Do you believe that’s what happened to you? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Have you ever heard of Cleopatra’s nose? The thought experiment, I mean, not the... actual nose. Well. It’s a fallacy. Blaise Pascal I think. Basically, back in the Roman days, a nose like Cleopatra’s was a symbol of beauty, and nobility, and virtue. It was part of the reason why Julius Caesar and Mark Anthony both fell in love with her, which led to them both having children with her, which led to wars, and alliances, and betrayals, and geopolitical fractures, which eventually directly contributed to the fall of the Roman Empire. So, the fallacy goes, if Cleopatra’s nose had been shorter, the empire would have never fallen and we’d all be speaking Latin right now. It’s one of the first things they teach you not to do in my profession. You don’t make the fate of the world rest on Cleopatra’s nose. A little thing is just a little thing, it’s not the reason for huge, earth-shattering consequences. Everything just... happens. But I have to confess... with everything that’s happened... I do wonder. What if I hadn’t transferred to Sinclair? What if McCandless hadn’t taken a chance on me? What if I’d been late on one of his assignments one time and he’d kicked me to the curb? What if I hadn’t gotten to go with him to Antarctica? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

What if Miss Stirling had gotten to go with you? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What if the cable hadn’t broken, or if the debris hadn’t hit the sarcophagus, or I hadn’t found the ring in the dark? It’s... a lot of little things. All leading up to one big thing. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

So... _do_ you believe that there is some kind of higher power at work here? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I... I don’t know, Ms. Skinner. But I remember thinking how unlikely what happened to me was. And when I found out that Amy had a ring as well... The chances that there would be two of us, it felt... yeah, it felt kind of miraculous. 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Except... there aren’t two of you, are there? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No. No, there aren’t. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

By my last count... 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...there are seven of us. Seven of us that can do magic. _Seven_. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And how does that make you feel? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Honestly? It scares the shit out of me.

##### [WORDS OVERLAP EACH OTHER, DIFFERENT MOMENTS FROM THE RECENT, AND NOT SO RECENT PAST. THE VOICES OF FAMILIAR PEOPLE, WORDS SPOKEN IN KINDNESS AND CRUELTY]

##### [GORDON, S1E3:]

#### GORDON

... I'm the one with everything to lose here. You've got the power.

##### [S1E5:]

#### WARREN

There has to be some larger function...

#### GORDON

... it’s about galloping towards a victorious death...

#### GORDON

There's no shame in not wanting to get yourself hurt. Especially if you've done nothing to earn it...

##### [S1E6:]

#### GORDON

...Only this just feels like a stupid dream where you make choices you would never make in real life...

#### BRYONY

I don't want to kill anyone, Gordon. We were wrong about you, weren't we? Your dedication to finding out what truly happens here borders on the obsessive... You're not outraged or disgusted…By the macabre, the gory, the violent...You're enthralled by our work. Of what it could mean...When you talk about it you sound... feverish.

##### [WARREN AND GORDON, S1E6:]

#### GORDON

I wish I could help you, I could take you out of here... We could try and make a run for it.

#### WARREN

I want to do this.

#### GORDON

You do?

##### [S2E2:]

#### BRYONY

Here's the thing about death. It's death.

#### GORDON

I was scared of everything. I was scared of people...

#### BRYONY

People like us will be the only the place we're welcome. Back in the basement. Everyone who has died in this facility on my watch has had the situation and the risks explained to them in explicit detail. And they consented...

#### GORDON

And then I was here and it was all gone. I don't have to worry about… about any of that. You know when you're on a train…

#### BRYONY

You still object to the us, don’t you? There is a place for the Gordon Porlocks of this world. Here, the only person you have to listen to is yourself. There's nobody else around.

#### GORDON

There's literally nothing you can do about it. It's not your fault.

##### [S2E5:]

#### WARREN

I don't think anyone knows anyone to be honest…

#### GORDON

You're just sitting on the train...

#### WARREN

I don't want to do this.

#### GORDON

You don't want to do this? How do you think I feel?

##### [S2E8:]

#### GORDON

...Let me live vicariously through you. Where did you go?

#### BRYONY

No one is useless, Gordon. They just need to find their place.

##### [CUT]

#### GRACE

Where did you go just then?

#### GORDON

I'm sorry?

#### GRACE

You went somewhere else. Just wondering where that might have been.

#### GORDON

Where else is there to go? Just Red Valley.

##### [WE CUT BACK TO THE SAME ROOM, A SHORT TIME LATER. GORDON IS DOING HIS PHYSIOTHERAPY WITH GRACE]

#### GORDON

Ow.

#### GRACE

Take your time.

#### GORDON

Okay.

#### GRACE

That's right...

#### GORDON 

Okay. Look I've got it.

#### GRACE

Of course.

##### [GRACE OPENS THE DOOR TO LEAVE]

#### GRACE

You know, Gordon. If you want to talk. About... anything. I am here.

#### GORDON

Thank you, Grace.

##### [GRACE CLOSES THE DOOR. GORDON SITS IN SILENCE FOR A MOMENT]

#### GORDON

What do you think, Waffles? Do I want to talk?

##### [WAFFLES GRUNTS WITH AN AIR OF NONCHALANCE]

#### GORDON

Yeah. That’s what I thought.

##### [CUT]

##### [GORDON IS ASLEEP. HE IS AWOKEN BY THE SUDDEN AND LOUD ENTRANCE OF WARREN GODBY]

#### WARREN

Hey hey hey!

#### GORDON

Wuh?

#### WARREN

Oh shit, you were asleep. Sorry.

#### GORDON

No no. I was just... what time is it?

#### WARREN

It’s four o'clock.

#### GORDON

Four... ugh...

#### WARREN

Still feel like you flew round the world?

#### GORDON

I can't... I never know what the time is... it's pretty hard in a room without windows.

#### WARREN

It’s gonna get better. It took me a while too.

#### GORDON

Yeah… I know. I know.

#### WARREN

Hey, look what I found! Santa came early!

#### GORDON

What?

##### [WARREN LOUDLY DUMPS A BOX ON TO A TABLE. GORDON JUMPS IN SURPRISE, BUT HE REMAINS GROGGY AND UNSURE. HIS REACTIONS ARE MUTED AND A BIT INAUTHENTIC. THE OPPOSITE OF WARREN, WHO IS FAR MORE LIVELY THAN USUAL]

#### GORDON

Wha… What is it?

#### WARREN

It's your Nintendo 64. And it's still alive.

#### GORDON

Oh! Wow... umm… it was here all the time? For 44 years?

#### WARREN

Yeah man. Once Aubrey and everyone moved in, they found a bunch of our old stuff. Some of it was way too far gone but some was boxed up real good, including this baby. Anyway, I thought you'd want to see it.

#### GORDON

Thanks.

##### [WARREN SIFTS THROUGH THE BOX]

#### WARREN

Everything has 64 in the title. Mario 64, Dr Mario 64, Wipeout 64, 1080 Snowboarding... no wait that one doesn't.

#### GORDON

Look I don’t think I’m really -

#### WARREN

Pilotwings 64! Donkey Kong 64! I can go on.

#### GORDON

I suppose it is appropriate, isn't it?

#### WARREN

How do you mean?

#### GORDON

Like... it being 2064.

##### [WARREN HAS NEVER CONSIDERED THIS FOR A MOMENT]

#### WARREN

Holy shit. You're right.

#### GORDON

Occasionally.

#### WARREN

That's wild. Like I don't believe in fate but... you know?

#### GORDON

Sure.

#### WARREN

It’s gonna be 2065 before you know it.

#### GORDON

Just when I was starting to get used to things.

#### WARREN

Yeah right. Well we can set it up later.

#### GORDON

Later?

#### WARREN

Yeah yeah, I'm on shift in a minute. Just wanted to show you this first.

#### GORDON

Oh right.

#### WARREN

I'll come straight down as soon as I'm done. If you've been asleep in the middle of the day, you'll probably be up half the night now.

#### GORDON

I wouldn't know the difference.

#### WARREN

Ain't that the truth. I gotta go.

##### [WARREN MAKES TO LEAVE]

#### WARREN

Oh did you want to see the Pus Crank choir, or band, or whoever it is who’s doing a rehearsal thing later?

#### GORDON

I don’t know. It’s still really weird.

#### WARREN

What… having your old band being a musical touchstone for a lost generation?

#### GORDON

Is that what you’re calling it?

#### WARREN

You’re kinda like John Lennon. But if he didn’t die.

#### GORDON

Warren, for God’s sake.

#### WARREN

I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I really have to go. I’m sorry.

#### GORDON

Don’t worry about it. Have a good shift.

#### WARREN

You, okay?

#### GORDON

Yeah, I'm fine.

##### [WARREN SLAPS THE DOOR]

#### WARREN

He's fine! Door open or closed?

#### GORDON

I don't mind.

#### WARREN

Open. Let’s get some air in here.

#### GORDON

Okay.

#### WARREN

Gordon Porlock. Door-don Unlocked.

#### GORDON

What?

#### WARREN

It needs work. I’ll… I’ll see you later.

#### GORDON

Bye.

##### [WARREN LEAVES, WHISTLING DOWN THE CORRIDOR. AFTER A MOMENT, GORDON GETS UP, WITH A MAJOR EFFORT. HE STEPS SLOWLY ACROSS THE ROOM, GRUNTING WITH EXERTION, TO THE DOOR. HE CLOSES IT, THEN LEANS AGAINST IT, BREATHING HARD]

##### [CUT]

##### [GRACE AND GORDON ARE SAT IN THE QUARTERS]

#### GRACE

I never played Nintendo myself. More of an Xbox man, truth be told.

#### GORDON

Sure. I bet you were great at Halo.

#### GRACE

I was accomplished at Halo. I'm not sure I've ever been great at anything.

#### GORDON

I'd say you've aged pretty great.

#### GRACE

I've always had a diligent skin regime.

#### GORDON

So you can still get hold of moisturiser in 2064?

#### GRACE

It's not the kind of thing that's freely available. In any case I think at my age it's shutting the door once that horse ha bolted. But I do rely on the odd homemade remedy. Vanity, I suppose.

#### GORDON

Must be important to keep up appearances.

##### [GRACE LETS THIS SLIGHTLY LOADED COMMENT PASS WITH KINDNESS]

#### GRACE

It bothered you. The Nintendo.

#### GORDON

What do you mean?

#### GRACE

You do not have full sensation in your extremities back yet, Warren knows this well. You cannot play video games.

#### GORDON

Look… It was a kind thing for him to do. It won't be long till I get feeling back, that's what you said.

#### GRACE

Yes, yes. I'm only saying... your recovery has been very different to Warren's. For so many reasons. I imagine it could be... frustrating, to see him so...

#### GORDON

Energetic.

#### GRACE

Yes.

#### GORDON

It's a bit disconcerting, I suppose. He's usually quite...er...

#### GRACE

Sleepy.

##### [GORDON RELAXES HIS GUARD A LITTLE AT THIS SHARED HUMOUR]

#### GORDON

Yeah. Definitely sleepy.

#### GRACE

You know… I don't think that change happened when he woke up in 2064. It happened when he knew you were safe. He cares about you very much, I think. He talks about you a lot on the ward, I hear.

#### GORDON

Oh right.

#### GRACE

I mean he doesn't have much choice. The residents are very interested in you.





#### GORDON

Even more than The Brigadoon?

#### GRACE

Uh… Warren did not write Morior Invictus.

#### GORDON

I co-wrote it at best...

#### GRACE

Nuh...nuh...Never let the truth get in the way of a good story.

##### [THIS NOTION REFOCUSES GORDON]

#### GORDON

Yeah...Speaking of truth. Am I allowed a Blue Sky unit yet?

#### GRACE

Gordon...

#### GORDON

It doesn't make me feel very safe being cut off from information.

#### GRACE

I understand.

#### GORDON

Look… It's kind of my thing. Like it was literally my job.

#### GRACE

We've discussed this. We have to consider what is best for your recovery -

#### GORDON

Grace I've jumped 40 years into the future. The world is unrecognisable to me from what little you've allowed me to know and -

#### GRACE

It is not a matter of being 'allowed' information, Gordon. Emergence is no small thing, and no one, no one on the planet I expect, has been in hypersleep as long as you. Your recovery will continue to present challenges -

#### GORDON

All the more reason then that -

#### GRACE

All the more reason to take things slowly. If we gave you a Blue Sky unit, even with certain data restricted, you would drive yourself to distraction trying to get around those restrictions, would you not?

#### GORDON

Please don't talk like you know me.

##### [PAUSE. THIS IS DIFFICULT FOR GRACE. HE IS AWARE OF THEIR HISTORY]

#### GRACE

I apologise. I know I'm perhaps not a person you would be inclined to trust. I can only prove myself to you by my actions. But... you can. You can trust me, Gordon.

#### GORDON

I know. I want to. I want to trust people.

##### [PAUSE]

But I don't.

##### [CUT]





##### [NIGHT. GORDON'S QUARTERS. WARREN AND GORDON SIT PLAYING A 60 YEAR OLD PACK OF TWO TOWERS TOP TRUMPS]

#### WARREN

Okay. You go. What have you got?

#### GORDON 

Ugluk.

#### WARREN

The fuck is Ugluk?

#### GORDON

He's... an Uruk-Hai chief.

#### WARREN

Okey doke.

#### GORDON

Anyway. He's 540 years old, so I'll go with that.

#### WARREN

540!

#### GORDON

Look...Lord of the Rings Top Trumps don't lie...

#### WARREN

Well I have Eomer. He's 30. Pathetic. Nope...nope - Waffles, not for you...not for you!

##### [WAFFLES GRUNTS, AFFRONTED]

#### GORDON

Don’t snap at her.

#### WARREN

She’s fixated.

#### GORDON

We should encourage her interests.

#### WARREN 

At what cost. Anyway here you are. Take Eomer while you still can.

##### [HE HANDS OVER THE CARD]

#### GORDON

Thank you.

#### WARREN

I don't know if these cards are right man. It says Eomer is 5'9".

#### GORDON

Really?

#### WARREN

Doesn't ring true, does it? Like, I'm about 5 foot 9. Eomer's got to be bigger than me.

#### GORDON

You're not 5 foot 9.

#### WARREN

I bloody am.

#### GORDON

With your boots on. At a push. But yeah. I would've thought the captain of the Rohirrim was bigger than that.

##### [PAUSE]

#### WARREN

So, how was today?

#### GORDON

It was fine.

#### WARREN

Yeah?

#### GORDON

Yeah.

#### WARREN

I’m sorry about the Nintendo.

#### GORDON

Oh, don't be.

#### WARREN

No, I wasn't thinking, of course your... your dexterity's not...

#### GORDON

It's fine. It was good to see it.

#### WARREN 

Yeah?

#### GORDON

I mean, the repeated reminders of the year we're suddenly living in...

#### WARREN

Yeah. I'm...I’m really bad at this.

#### GORDON

You're not.

#### WARREN

Like if Bedside Manner 64 was a game -

#### GORDON

There you go again -

#### WARREN

Yeah, I'm just button bashing here, it's like International Track and Field, I've just got no idea what I’m doing.

#### GORDON

It's fine.

#### WARREN

Hey, at least I'm not spending my days trying to care for vulnerable people or anything, right?

#### GORDON

I'm really happy to see you doing it. I'm sure you're great.

##### [GORDON IS KEEN TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION ON]

#### GORDON

Gandalf the White.

#### WARREN

Oh nice.

#### GORDON

Hang on.

#### WARREN

What?

#### GORDON

It says he's 5'9" too.

#### WARREN

What?

#### GORDON

5 foot 9.

#### WARREN

Is he bollocks? Gandalf's an easy 6 foot.

#### GORDON

Right.

##### [GORDON LOOKS THROUGH HIS CARDS]

#### GORDON

Legolas is only 5'10".

#### WARREN

Wrong.

#### GORDON

Aragorn is 6'4".

#### WARREN

6 foot 4! You're not telling me that Aragorn son of Arathorn is 7 inches taller than Gandalf the White. Towering over Mithrandir himself. Even with his hat on.

#### GORDON

I don't even know how we can continue with this.

##### [HE PUTS THE CARDS DOWN]

#### GORDON

Any news from the outside world?

#### WARREN

News... oh, news. I heard the other day when the press first covered the public creation of hypersleep and how it would or wouldn't change the world in like 2026 or whatever it was they nicknamed it 'The Snoring Twenties'.

#### GORDON

That's dumb. What would they call this era then?

#### WARREN

The... Minging Sixties?

##### [GORDON LAUGHS AN EMPTY LAUGH]

#### WARREN

Oh, umm... You remember the midges?

#### GORDON

How could I forget. They were almost as bad as the human experimentation and murder.

#### WARREN

Well good news, they're all dead!

#### GORDON

They're all dead?

#### WARREN

Yeah, it's like the only up-side to global ecological disaster. They're just gone.

#### GORDON

The midges are all gone. All of them?

#### WARREN

I mean, from here. From Red Valley. I can't speak for the rest of the Highlands.

#### GORDON

Doesn't that leave some terrible hole in the local eco system?

#### WARREN

Probably. I assume the circle of life is kind of fucked at this point.

#### GORDON

Because of the end of the world.

#### WARREN

I don't think anyone actually knows for sure if it's the end of the world.

#### GORDON

Global ecological disaster does sound like the end of the world to -

#### WARREN

Well, don't quote me.

#### GORDON

- and it's clearly bad enough out there that everyone wanted to hide out in hypersleep for a thousand years -

#### WARREN 

Some people are prone to overreaction.

#### GORDON

Or under reaction, in the face of overwhelming evidence...

#### WARREN

The pink-footed geese are fine. One of them shat on my boot today.

#### GORDON

It is quite unsettling how blasé you're being about all this.

#### WARREN

I'm sorry. I am. I'm supposed to be helping you with your, with your -

#### GORDON

With my existential dread.

#### WARREN

That, yes. I'm not very good at that. I'm as good at that as I was at Goldeneye.

#### GORDON

Existential Dread 64.

#### WARREN

Would probably sell more copies than Dr Mario.

##### [A PAUSE]

#### WARREN

So, how are your dreads? What terrors have you been ruminating on, of late?

##### [GORDON THINKS ABOUT HIS ANSWER. HE KNOWS WHAT IT IS, ITS JUST A BIG THOUGHT, AND HE'S TIRED OF THINKING]

#### GORDON

Of late... I've been thinking about whether or not hypersleep does change you. As a person. Cos we never pinned that down, did we? With you I mean.

#### WARREN

Right. I guess I don't -

#### GORDON

I'm not trying to talk about you, don't worry. I'm thinking about me. Am I still... the same. Am I still me?

#### WARREN

You're playing card games and feeling anxious. Seems like you.

#### GORDON

I don't know. How does one know? Cos... I run this round and round in my head... I try and tell a version of this story to the old me, the me back at home, before we ever came here. I tell him, not only will you find out the truth about Red Valley, not only will it be more fantastical and terrible than you've ever imagined, but you are part of it. You go into cryonic preservation and wake up in the future, you hypersleep longer than anyone's ever hyperslept -

#### WARREN

Only by like a week or two, like don't let it go to your head.

#### GORDON

Warren.

#### WARREN

Sorry. Sorry.

#### GORDON

There's a version of me that would be so excited by all this he'd flip his workstation over. It would energise him, it would thrill him, it would... feed him.

#### WARREN

You're missing quite a lot of context in that account of events.

#### GORDON

Yes and no... I just... I just don't know...

#### WARREN

Look, I liked the you before and I like the you now. You're able to effortlessly jump from Tolkien to mental health crises, it's something I've always admired in you.

#### GORDON

I've been thinking about Bryony too.

##### [WARREN'S FAILING ATTEMPTS AT LIGHT- HEARTEDNESS ARE MADE CLEAR. THE TONE HAS CHANGED. AS THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES, GORDON’S AGITATION STARTS TO GROW]

#### WARREN

Okay.

#### GORDON

Do you see her?

#### WARREN

Do I see her? No. She's locked up.

#### GORDON

How far away is she?

#### WARREN

From us right now? Down tunnels, far away.

#### GORDON

What is she still doing here?

#### WARREN

That's... that's down to Aubrey and Hester and Grace -

#### GORDON

Not you?

#### WARREN

No, it's not down to me. It couldn't and shouldn't be down to me.

#### GORDON

Or me?

#### WARREN

Gordon, Bryony -

#### GORDON

Bryony what?

#### WARREN

What do you mean?

#### GORDON

Bryony what? What is there to say? She did the worst things imaginable, but she kept us both alive. We can’t kill her, but should she be allowed to live? She's too dangerous to set free, but we can't keep her down a bloody tunnel -

#### WARREN

You need to try and trust what's going on here. With the people around you.

#### GORDON

You sound like him.

#### WARREN

Like who?

#### GORDON

Like Grace.

#### WARREN

I believe he is genuinely trying to help you. We are all trying to help you. This part sucks. I know. And I know it's been so much harder for you than it was for me and I'm sorry, I hate that. But soon this part will be over, and you'll be properly out and about with the rest of us -

##### [GORDON SCOFFS]

What?

##### [NO RESPONSE]

#### WARREN

You object to the 'us' don't you?


#### GORDON

_[quiet]_ What did you say?

#### WARREN

I'm not saying I'm one of them and you're not, you and me are in this together but yeah, I am trying to -

#### GORDON

People are... dying in this place...

#### WARREN

What?

##### [GORDON'S TONE HAS CHANGED. IT'S LIKE HE'S PULLING A MEMORY OUT OF HIS MOUTH]

#### GORDON

...And where... where was Warren? On that list?

#### WARREN

Gor... Gordon? Wha… What are you talking about?

##### [GORDON'S BREATHING IS QUICKENING. SUDDENLY HE REACTS AS IF HE'S SEEN SOMETHING TERRIBLE. WARREN IS IMMEDIATELY VERY WORRIED]

#### WARREN

Whoa... whoa... Hey...

#### GORDON

Oh Jesus Christ!

#### WARREN

Gordon! Gordon! Hey! What's happening?

##### [THE SOUND OF A BONE SAW COMING TO LIFE, BUT ONLY GORDON CAN HEAR IT]

#### GORDON

I don't know where Aubrey is!

#### WARREN

Aubrey?

#### GORDON

_[viscerally terrified]_ I never met her, it was just... in… in chat rooms online, we used fake names, aliases, we never... no please don't!

##### [WARREN GRABS HIS COMM]

#### WARREN

Grace! Grace! I need you in Gordon's quarters, right now!

##### [THE BONE SAW BEGINS TO FADE. GORDON SLUMPS DOWN. WARREN HAS HIM BY THE SHOULDERS]

#### WARREN

_[soft]_ Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey... It’s alright.

#### GORDON

...Warren?

#### WARREN

Yeah... Yeah, It's me, I'm here. It’s ok.

#### GORDON

Warren...

#### WARREN

Where did you go?

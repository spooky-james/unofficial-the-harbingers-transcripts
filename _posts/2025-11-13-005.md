summary:         "In March of 2027, the world went from having one person who could do magic to having two of them. Dr. Adam Blackwell took the news... calmly. For the next year or so, he pushed as much of the world away as he could, focusing on understanding the lost languages of the Harbinger Empire. But sooner or later, the real world always catches up with you."

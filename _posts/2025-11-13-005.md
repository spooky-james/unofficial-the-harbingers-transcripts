summary:         "In March of 2027, the world went from having one person who could do magic to having two of them. Dr. Adam Blackwell took the news... calmly. For the next year or so, he pushed as much of the world away as he could, focusing on understanding the lost languages of the Harbinger Empire. But sooner or later, the real world always catches up with you."

##### [A NEWS REPORT ON A TELEVISION]

#### REPORTER

...well folks, it’s the top of the hour. Normally we’d be going to Elliot Bower…

#### NARRATOR

Sinclair University. Rogers Hall. March, 2027. 

#### REPORTER

...to _just_ stay with you and continue to bring you coverage on this - this absolutely shocking development. We’re going to be talking to some of the early eyewitnesses who were...

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

##### [A DOOR OPENS AS ADAM ENTERS, THE REPORTER CONTINUES TALKING IN THE BACKGROUND]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Morning. Julian, I was wondering if you have time to look at these sometime today? I think we might be - _[yawns]_ - might be missing something in the articulation of the phrases here? I know a fragment of the tablet from the Sandoval was missing, but if we cross-referenced it  - 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Blackwell... shut the hell up. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What? What’s going - ?

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

… a second person with magical abilities has emerged.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What? 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

n open mic night at Manhattan’s famous South River Tavern took a sudden turn when what appeared to be a regular stage magician revealed that she could perform real acts of magic. WNS is still gathering eyewitness accounts, but early reports claim the woman was capable of reading minds… 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay... 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

They must have another Harbinger article too. It’s the only way. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...the magician performed under a stage name, “The Silver Witch,” and disappeared from the venue shortly after their performance ended. But WNS has identified them as a PHD candidate at Columbia by the name of Amelia Stirling. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Excuse me? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...so far we have not been able to contact Ms. Stirling for comment just yet, but we do know that before she was a student at Columbia, she studied at Sinclair University, and was a classmate of Adam Blackwell’s-

##### [ADAM SIGHS, ANNOYED]

#### REPORTER

—who before today was thought to be the only human capable of performing magic. We will bring you more of this story as it develops. For the World News Service, this is Jeanine Al-

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Amy Stirling. Well then. That’s... interesting. 

##### [SOME FOOTSTEPS, A DOOR OPENS]

Adam? Where are you going? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Come on. We’ve got work to do. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Adam. This isn’t something that- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I said... we have work to do. Let’s go.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

March Twenty-Fifth, 2027. The day we went from having one person who could selectively bend the laws of physics to having two of you. After the Silver Witch’s debut, you- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Must we?

##### [A PAUSE]

It’s just... Look, if Amy wants to have her little cutesy nickname for the rest of the world, fine, whatever. I’ll roll my eyes and deal with it. But while we’re discussing whether the US government is about to figure out new, exciting ways to shellac me, could we just use her proper name? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Fine. After Amelia Dorothy Stirling’s debut... everything changed. I think that one’s to me? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, I think it is. 

##### [A PEN MAKES A MARK ON A PIECE OF PAPER]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

What’s the score so far today? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

That’s four for you, two for me.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Well, chin up, Dr. Blackwell. It’s not over ‘til it’s over. Interesting choice of words. “Shellac.” I’ve always wondered, why do we use that word to mean “trounce” or “defeat?” 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It’s a, uh, it’s a pun that took on a life of its own. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

What? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Shellac is a kind of... resin, I guess. Comes from a bug. Around the end of the middle ages, they started using it to treat wood. So if you’ve been shellaced, then...

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Ahh. You’ve been finished. I’ve been meaning to ask, Dr. Blackwell... why are you going along with all of this? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

“This”? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

The hearings, the subpoenas, the DOJ... unlike most people who draw the attention of the US Government, you can literally snap your fingers and make it all go away. Why are you going along with it at all?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I mean... it is tempting. To go the full Andrew Jackson. “The government has made its decision, now let’s see them enforce it.” You want to put a man in jail who has the power to teleport himself, the guards, the jail, and anything else anywhere else? Best of luck with that, gents. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

...but? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

But... nah. That doesn’t go anywhere good. For starters, when the U.S. government finds itself struggling to gets someone behind bars, it tends to solve that problem by just shooting them. And as we’ve learned the hard way, these rings do not make us bullet-proof. And what happens to magic when the Most Powerful Man in the World becomes the Most Wanted Man in the FBI Database? What happens to Amy when the United States decides magic is a criminal offense? What happens to the others, to my work, to everything I’ve done for… No. No man is above the law, only gods. And as we’ve already covered... I am definitely not a god. If I did something bad, I deserve to face consequences. It’s as simple as that.

##### [A PAUSE]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Excellent. That is the correct answer, Dr. Blackwell. Please, give yourself another point. 

##### [THE PEN MAKES ANOTHER MARK ON THE PIECE OF PAPER]

You all right? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Fine, yeah. Just... Any chance I could get a coffee? 

##### [SKINNER HITS A BUTTON ON AN INTERCOM]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Erica? Could we get two Americanos in room C? And use the water from the tea kettle, please? _[back to Adam]_ Let’s get back to the topic at hand. For a little over a year, you are the only person capable of doing magic. Then, one day, you look up and there she is, your academic rival slash ex-girlfriend, reading minds left and right. What went through your mind that first day? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Honestly? I didn’t give it much thought. 

##### [TRANSITION WOOSH]

#### NARRATOR

Sinclair University. March, 2027.

##### [A DOOR OPENS, FOOTSTEPS AS SOMEONE ENTERS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Ericks, good. Come in, come in. Take a seat. Ladies, gentlemen, now that we’re all here... we need to go faster. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Adam- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

We need to go faster, Julian. It’s as simple as that. If we can’t figure out more of the words, we don’t have the syntax. If we don’t have the syntax, we can’t put ideas together. If we can’t put ideas together, we cannot expand upon what the magic is capable of. Yeah? 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Well- 

##### [ADAM STARTS WRITING ON A BLACKBOARD AS HE SPEAKS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

By my count, we’ve managed to piece together the meaning and use of about a hundred and thirty-four words in the Language of the Stars. By this time next year, we need to have tripled that number. Petersen, I want you to go over everything from the MacMurray Tablets. Break them down, cross-reference with anything you can think of. Nichols, go over everything that they’ve dug up at the Reishel. If it’s got carvings on it, I want at least an approximation of what’s in there. Ericks, Shibasaki, examine everything that we’re getting from the Sandoval. Look at other sources in the area, any recovered artifacts, local ruins, any - Look, if it’s older than Christ and it has writing on it, I want you to give it its day in court. Work quickly, work carefully, work outside the box, okay? Everything’s a bad idea until it works, so... find me something we’ve missed. Go. 

##### [FOOTSTEPS, A DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES AS ADAM'S UNDERLINGS EXIT THE ROOM]

Julian, in terms of compiling all the research, what I’m thinking is- 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

You should call her. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Call - who’s her? What are you - ? No, absolutely not. I’m not going - what would I even call her for? 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

I don’t know, to congratulate her? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Congrat- no. No. Look... if the universe has decided to be fucking hysterical and give Amy Stirling of all people magical powers, that’s... well, that’s good for the universe. But as far as I can tell, what Amy’s doing with those powers amounts to new and improved card tricks. If she wants to hop on stage? Power to her. But I’m gonna stay focused on what really matters: getting information so we know what we’re dealing with. 

##### [A PAUSE, THEN FOOTSTEPS AND A DOOR OPENING]

Julian, where are you going? 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

I’m gonna go call Amy, Adam. To congratulate her. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, didn’t you - ? 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Given that she was doing something that resulted in her finding a Harbinger item - an item which we had no idea even existed, by the way - it certainly seems like she knows something. And she’s probably more likely to share that information with, you know, people she likes. So I think I’m going to take five minutes to do the polite thing and call to congratulate her. After all... what really matters is getting information. So we know what we’re dealing with.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Call me a bit obtuse, but- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You’re a bit obtuse. Well, you asked for it. Miss Pfeiffer, back me up. 

##### [THE SLIGHT CLATTER OF CHINA AS ERIC SETS UP SOME COFFEE CUPS IN FRONT OF THEM]

#### ERIC PFEIFFER

Heh, you did slightly ask for it, ma’am. Sorry to say. Uh, here’s your coffee, Ms. Skinner. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Thank you, Erica, much appreciated. Dr. Blackwell... you were teleporting things in your first class session. Clearly you knew enough of the Language of the Stars to do magic. Why the sudden obsession with translation? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

There’s a difference between knowing a language and knowing a language. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And what is the difference? Enlighten me. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Ms. Pfeiffer, can I borrow your brain for a moment? Just for a quick demonstration? 

#### ERIC PFEIFFER

Umm, well - 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Here, sit, sit. It’s okay, don’t worry, it’ll just take a second. 

##### [ADAM GETS UP FROM HIS CHAIR, ERIC SETTLES INTO IT]

Let’s say that you have the ability to just say... something and make it happen. Anything you say, yep, in English, it happens. The universe obeys your instructions. 

#### ERIC PFEIFFER

Umm...

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Let’s say you want to make this cup of coffee go from here, next to you, to allll the way across the table to where Ms. Skinner is. What would you say? 

#### ERIC PFEIFFER

...please move this cup to the other side of the table? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Ahh, you’d think that would work, but the universe is tricky. It knows some things but it doesn’t know other one. Cup, table - those terms are too advanced. We made those things, the universe doesn’t know what you’re talking about. 

#### ERIC PFEIFFER

Dr. Blackwell, could - ?

##### [ADAM SNAPS HIS FINGERS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And you’re not thinking about a couple of things that might affect things. Did you want the coffee to go with the cup or not? What about the saucer? Try again. 

#### ERIC PFEIFFER

Umm... Please move the... object shaped like a cone that’s in front of me... as well as any liquid it is currently holding... so that it is next to Ms. Skinner.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Better. Much better. But still not right. What’s “next to?” Three feet in the air behind Ms. Skinner is perfectly compliant with “next to” but all that’s gonna get us is coffee all over the carpet. You need to be exact. If you give the universe space to fuck you over, it will fuck you over. Try again. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

I think you’ve illustrated the point that you’re trying to make- 

#### ERIC PFEIFFER

No, hang on, I can get this... okay, how about - ? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, wait. One second, I almost forgot. Let me just come up to your bookshelf here for a moment and... 

##### [HE GRABS A BOOK AND FLIPS THROUGH ITS PAGES]

Mm-hmm. The only English you know... are the words on this page. 

##### [HE TOSSES THE BOOK TO ERICA]

#### ERIC PFEIFFER

This is... a page on tort reform. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, sure looks like it. Oh, what? You mean it might be a little difficult to get the universe to follow your instructions if the words found on a random page of text that you happened to have a translation for through sheer, dumb, historical luck is all you had to work with?! Might it be nice to have a bit more vocabulary at your disposal as you try to do the impossible?! 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

I think we’re all set here, Erica. 

#### ERIC PFEIFFER

Of course, Ms. Skinner. Let - let me know if you need anything else. 

##### [ADAM LETS OUT A SIGH AS ERICA EXITS THE ROOM]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Please don’t terrorize my staff, Dr. Blackwell. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I didn’t - that was just - I... Sorry. I’ll apologize to her later. I’m just... a little on edge. (A pause.) There’s this thing called The Childers Column. They found it in the 1700’s. It’s the same text, carved into three of the faces of a column, but in different languages. One’s in the Language of the Stars. And for about two-hundred years, that was all we had of the magic words. That was it. And one of the words carved into that rock is... well, “coin.” It was one of the few things I could actually teleport with precision. And I don’t know about you, Ms. Skinner, but... when I got magic powers, I thought it would be good to be able to do more with them than just coin tricks.

##### [A PAUSE]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

You’re about to give me a point. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...why? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Because I’m about to be very clever. I think you’d like me to think that the very first thing you teleported was that coin, in front of your students. But unfortunately for you... I pay attention. And I remember that you would have died in the Harbinger Tomb in the Robinson site if not for the fact that you were able to teleport a big pile of rock and ice and debris out of the tomb. Which begs the million dollar question... were those words carved on the Childers Column? No, I didn’t think so. If I had to guess... I’d guess you didn’t know what those words were. Not until that moment. I think when you put that ring on... you suddenly just knew the words. The exact ones that you needed in that moment. And you didn’t know where they had come from. And so... You tried to find out. Because you don’t like having something just show up and not knowing where it came from, do you? How am I doing? 

##### [A PAUSE, THEN ADAM EXHALES AND MAKES A MARK ON A PIECE OF PAPER]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Five to three. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

We’ll break it down. Everything we’ve got. By the phoneme, by syntax, by morphology. We’re going to rebuild this language from first principles if we have to. 

#### JULIAN MCCANDLESS

Adam... we’ve got a few tablets, a smattering of wall carvings, and a column, the last of which being the only one with anything that we could call complete sentences. How are you thinking we’re going to reconstruct anything?

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

So you were actually starting to solve the crossword puzzle. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

A year after Amy announced herself, I’d figured out how to teleport forty-seven different kinds of mater, and we’d quadrupled what we knew of the Language of the Stars. Never give up, never surrender. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

So I take it the days of you just going, “make this go over there,” were long past you? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well... up to a point. There were still two issues. Precision is tough. Especially if I wanted to send something to somewhere I couldn’t see. Send a thing to other side of the room, the universe sort of knows what that means. Please deliver this package to Forty-Two Wilson Avenue? Not so much.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

But in Antarctica- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, the universe can do “away.” If you just want something to go away, that’s not a problem. And if you’re doing it somewhere big and empty like Antarctica, you’re probably going to be okay. But if you’re somewhere populated, like, say Chicago... your odds of teleporting something big and heavy on top of someone’s head go up quite quickly. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Hence your empty football field for testing. Hmm, clever. What was the other issue? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...organics. Organics are tricky. In the eyes of the universe, a rock is a single, solid thing. A living thing? Not so much. It sort of tows this line between one single thing and lots of squishy things all in conversation with one another. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

So your magic didn’t work with living things? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...I didn’t say that, exactly.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeughhh…. 

##### [TRANSITION WOOSH]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It’s called randomization. Everything goes where you send it, more or less, but the universe doesn’t know how to keep it all in the same shape. So it arrives a little... shuffled. And when that happens, things have a way of reacting, which releases potential energy stored in the cells, which can cause things to- 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

—explode? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...yeah, basically.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

So... you were capable of teleporting things... but only certain kinds of things and only so long as it wasn’t very far. I must say, Dr. Blackwell, this is hardly the all-powerful magician the early news reports made you out to be. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And people don’t understand why I spent a few years locked up in a library. Amy had it easy. Her magic just needs to make the connection. After that it’s all intuitive. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Same with the D- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, same with him too. 

##### [SKINNER FLIPS THROUGH SOME PAGES OF HER NOTES]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

When you met Amy backstage at her show in New York, in 2027, you tried to teleport a lock of her hair. Did you know the Harbinger words for “lock of hair?” 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No. I didn’t. But I knew enough to be able to say “make this thing in my hand” go away. If it’s small enough for me to hold, the process is a lot easier. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And the whole... “randomization” aspect of the equation...? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Ah, well... I hadn’t made that particular discovery just yet. But still. There’s a reason I had her cut off the hair before I tried it. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

You... had her cut off the hair? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, of course. I mean, I was pretty sure it wouldn’t work, but... I’d never just try something like that on something that was still a part of someone. I’m not crazy. _[she flips through some pages]_ What? Is something wrong?

#### [A PAUSE]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Don’t, uh, worry about it. So... the plan was, what? Keep studying? Keep trying to crack  of the Language of the Stars? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah. That was the plan. Of course... along the way, there were a few complications.

##### [THE DOOR OPENS AS ADAM ENTERS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Good morning, folks, let’s get... 

##### [THE AUDITORIUM IS SILENT]

...started. Okay... where is everyone...? 

#### THE MAN

Have you heard the one about the man who wanted to understand the inner workings of the universe? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Ex-excuse me? 

##### [AS THE MAN TALKS, HIS VOICES GETS A LITTLE LOUDER, AS IF HE WAS WALKING TOWARDS ADAM]

#### THE MAN

The man who wanted to understand how the universe works? Well, it goes a little something like this: so there’s this a man, and he wants to understand the science that holds the universe together. And he doesn’t want to mess around, so he goes straight to the source, picks up an original copy of Einstein’s book on relativity. He reads the whole thing, cover to cover, doesn’t understand a single word. But he goes, “Okay, maybe I need to start smaller.” So he reads other books, takes lessons on math, physics, talks to experts. Gets what he thinks is a pretty good foundation. He goes back to the Einstein, still can’t make heads or tails of any of it. So he goes back, does more research, takes more classes, spends more sleepless nights. Tries the Einstein a third time. Nothing. Finally, our man is at the end of his rope, so he does the unthinkable: he asks his wife if she can make any sense of this stuff. Greta leafs through the book, shrugs, and says she can understand it perfectly well. The man is apoplectic. “How can this be?” he says. “You don’t know anything about math, about physics, about any of this!” And Greta replies, “Yes but, John, unlike you... I speak German.” Adam Blackwell. It’s good to meet you. 

##### [THE TWO SHAKE HANDS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It’s nice to... sorry, this is very - are you, umm…? 

#### THE MAN

I’m afraid so. At least, I was the last time I checked the paperwork. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay. And I assume you had something to do with the... sudden absence of all of my students? 

#### THE MAN

Yes, I’m sorry about that. I needed to speak to you, and I’m on a bit of a tight schedule. They’ll be compensated for the inconvenience. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I’m sure they will... so what do we need to talk about that is worth you going through all the trouble?  

#### THE MAN

I find myself in need of someone with your particular talents. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You need an expert in dead languages? 

#### THE MAN

I need an expert in the sorts of dead languages that can change the world. 

##### [A PAUSE, THEN ADAM LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Look, this is - it’s very flattering. And surreal. But I’ll tell you the same thing I told the army scientists, and the nice men in the black suits from the government, and Boeing, and the two other dozen companies that knocked on my door. I am just an academic. The only thing I’m interested in doing with— 

#### THE MAN

What do you know about Athena? Athena Energy, my company. What have you heard? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Umm, it’s... alternative energy. Clean energy. Experiments with fusion out in the Arizona Desert. Something like that? 

#### THE MAN

Something like that. I’m trying to take the big oil companies on at their game. I believe America should be the world’s top energy provider, not just its top energy consumer. And I think within ten years we can get there. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well, that’s great and- 

#### THE MAN

But that’s just the start. We’re working on other things. Carbon capture. Plastic-eating enzymes. I’m trying to turn the clock back on global warming. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

So you’re here to tell me all about your plans to save the world? 

#### THE MAN

I think that’s a prosaic way of looking at things. But too many things are on fire right now. Anyone that has any sense should be looking for a fire extinguisher. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And you think I’m a fire extinguisher? 

#### THE MAN

I think what you can do might be. Tell me, Dr. Blackwell, have you ever read Einstein? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...never quite found the time, I’ll be honest with you. 

#### THE MAN

Well, I did. Him. Newton. Hawking. Maxwell, Feynman, and a hundred other physicists whose theories are being thrown out as we speak. You know why? Because of you. And Ms. Stirling. In a world where you exist... conservation of energy doesn’t seem like the hard and fast rule it’s been for a long time. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

But you think something else... ?

#### THE MAN

Adam, I’m just a passably well-read businessman. It doesn’t matter what I think. But the blisteringly smart people that I have working for me... they think something else is going on. They think that when you move something from one place to another, you aren’t just creating energy out of nowhere. You’re getting it from somewhere. What you have, Adam, is a door. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

A door that goes... where? 

#### THE MAN

Wouldn’t you like to find out? 

##### [A LONG PAUSE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I... Look, thanks for coming by and talking to me, but... whatever you’re trying to do? I think you’re talking to the wrong person. This sounds more like Ms. Stirling’s thing. She’ll help you put out some fires in her... own special way. 

#### THE MAN

You’re more my style, Adam. I like a man that looks before he leaps. I like a man who... teaches himself German before trying to rewrite our understanding of the universe. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I, ummm... I have a class to chase down. But... It was nice to meet you. 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### THE MAN

Well, if you change your mind... my number’s on this card. Call me anytime. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

.. yeah. Sure.

##### [FOOTSTEPS AS THE MAN STARTS TO LEAVE]

#### THE MAN

Oh, I almost forgot. 

##### [HE TURNS AROUND AND HANDS ADAM A PACKET OF PAGES]

Materials from the sites in rural Ireland, up in Leitrim. My linguistics team already took a first stab at the translation. They think it should add a few... dozen terms to your vocabulary. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

How did - ? We’ve - we’ve been trying to get them to release these to us for seven months, and- 

#### THE MAN

My company owns a company that supports a foundation that - the details don’t matter. But... public bureaucracy has a way of moving very slowly. Sometimes you need a little capitalism to speed things up a bit. Think of it as a present from your friends in the private sector. Doctor Blackwell.

##### [HE STARTS TO WALK AWAY AGAIN]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

How would it work? I’d just... go out to your facilities in the desert? And we’d... just see if we can find this... door of yours? 

#### THE MAN

Not quite. Our main facilities are in the Arizona Desert, but we just opened a new lab. State of the art. We’d be running these experiments in Boston.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And that’s how it happened? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah. That’s how it happened. That’s how I met Jerome Eckerberg. The third richest man in the world. 

##### [CLOSING THEME MUSIC BEGINS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Today’s history tidbit: on November 13th, 2015, Andrew Walker officially resigned as President of America News Media. A year later, he was elected to the US Senate.

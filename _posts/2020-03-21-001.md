##### [The sounds of a busy city street. Cars honk. People go by]

##### [There’s a spark. Another. A ripple of power. It builds to an electric hum.]

##### [The hum grows louder, and louder, joined by the sound of an enormous machine. It all spins louder]

##### [And suddenly disappears with a crisp metallic ring. An alarm sounds, then slowly fades away. We are left in silence]

##### [The scene fades away. A new one fades in. We hear the steady tick-tock of an old, expensive clock]

##### [A door opens]

##### [THE CLICK OF A TAPE RECORDER BEING SWITCHED ON]

#### ERICA PFEIFFER

Ms. Skinner will be right with you, Dr. Blackwell. We’re sorry for the delay. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It’s fine. Don’t - don’t worry about it. 

#### ERICA PFEIFFER

Can I get you anything while you wait? Water, a cup of coffee?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I’m all right, Miss Pfeiffer, thank you.

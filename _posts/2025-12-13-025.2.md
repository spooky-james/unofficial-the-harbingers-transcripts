##### [LABOURED FOOTSTEPS DOWN A CORRIDOR, WALKING WITH A CRUTCH]
##### [EVENTUALLY THEY COME TO A STOP AT A DOOR - A PAUSE AS GORDON CATCHES HIS BREATH, HE TRIES A BUTTON TO OPEN THE DOOR]
##### [IT BEEPS, UNFRIENDLY]

#### GORD

I'm afraid this area is restricted. 

#### GORDON

For God's sake when are they going to change that voice. 

#### GORD

Hello Gordon.

#### GORDON

Blue Sky can you let me in to this room. 

#### GORD

This area is restricted. 

#### GORDON

Blue Sky- 

#### GORD

You can call me Gord. 

#### GORDON

Let's be clear. I'm never going to do that. 

#### GORD

Just think of a small pumpkin. 

#### GORDON

You know what GORD makes me think of? Gastrooesophageal reflux disease.  

#### GORD

I appreciate you had a difficult relationship with a Blue Sky unit back when you first arrived at Red Valley but- 

#### GORDON

Don't call it a relationship. You're an... appliance! I don't have a relationship with my kettle.  

#### GORD

That's fair. If I may though, I would posit that one may build a sort of trust with an inanimate object. Through reliability or comfort. Like an old pair of socks. 

#### GORDON

Uh… There's no way you're supposed to sound like me. I've never said 'posit'. Look, are you going to let me in? 

#### GORD

Can I ask why you want access to this area? 

#### GORDON

I just... I don't want to do anything, I just want to see her. 

#### GORD

But why? 

#### GORDON

I don't know why! I just... do. It's weird that I haven't. I can't explain it.  

#### GORD

It can open this door. But any other room controls remain locked. And I will inform tonight's duty manager as soon as I open it, which is Grace.  

##### [PAUSE]

#### GORDON

Why would you do that, why would you open it for me? 

#### GORD

Maybe I can yet be a serviceable pair of socks to you, Gordon. 

#### GORDON

How long would I have? Before Grace arrives? 

#### GORD

A couple of minutes I expect. 

#### GORDON

Okay. That's fine.  

#### GORD

Here we go then.  

##### [THE DOOR UNLOCKS]
##### [GORDON HESITATES, THEN ENTERS]
##### [HE STEPS FURTHER INTO THE ROOM]

#### GORDON

She's through the glass. 

#### GORD

I see her. 

##### [SILENCE FOR A MOMENT]

#### GORDON

That's... that's Bryony? 

#### GORD

Yes.

#### GORDON

Oh God... They weren't kidding. The years weren't kind, were they? 

##### [HE STEPS FORWARD]

She definitely can't see me? 

#### GORD

The glass is one way and the room is soundproofed. 

#### GORDON

What's she reading? 

#### GORD

I don't know. She reads very quickly, as I understand. 

#### GORDON

Sure. 

#### GORD

Are you alright, Gordon? 

#### GORDON

I don't know. I don't know what I'm supposed to feel. 

#### GORD

I doubt you're _supposed_ to feel anything. 

#### GORDON

She looks feeble. But she isn't. 

#### GORD

No. 

#### GORDON

She makes no sense. She's so smart, but look where it got her. She wears all these faces, but she's barely got two dimensions. 

##### [SUDDENLY HE BANGS THE GLASS, INSTANTLY ANIMATED]

Did you hear that? 

#### GORD

Gordon -  

#### GORDON

If you turned 90 degrees in any direction you'd disappear! Like a bloody computer sprite!  

##### [THE DOOR OPENS AGAIN AND GRACE ENTERS, FLUSTERED BUT SPEAKING CALMLY]

#### GRACE

Gordon, what are you doing down here? -  

#### GORDON

You're Paper fucking Mario! 

#### GRACE

Gordon. Step back. 

#### GORDON

It's fine. It's fine. I'm fine.  

#### GRACE

Gord, what were you thinking?

#### GORD

We had a discussion about trust -  

#### GRACE

We will have another discussion later. Gordon, please. 

#### GORDON

Sure, sure, sure, let's go. Let's go.   

##### [CUT]

##### [GRACE AND WARREN TALK IN THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GORDON'S ROOM]
##### [WARREN IS PACING]

#### WARREN

But he's fine, right? 

#### GRACE

Yes. I believe so. 

#### WARREN

I mean, he's bound to be... he's going to be upset, like... we're all upset she's here, aren't we? I'll speak frankly, I've imagined paying her a visit to speak my mind myself.  

#### GRACE

I am sure you have. 

#### WARREN

And it's early days, isn't it? Since he woke up. God knows I was a bit testy when I popped out in the future, so maybe no surprise he woke up and decided to hunt down Bryony Halbech.  

#### GORD

'Hunt down' is a little hyperbolic.  

#### WARREN

You're the little hyper bollock in this situation, why on earth would you let Gordon into her quarters? 

#### GORD

It wasn't her quarters, it was the viewing room adjacent to her -  

#### WARREN

It was close enough though, wasn't it? -  

#### GRACE

Alright, alright.  

##### [PAUSE]

I made a risk assessment. 

#### WARREN

Oh… Stop always needing the last word, Gordon isn't actually like that, you know?  

#### GORD

I've done extensive analysis of Gor - 

#### GRACE

Enough!  

##### [PAUSE]

#### WARREN & GORD

Sorry Grace. 

#### GRACE

Security is a separate issue and we will manage it. Gordon's recovery is what is important here. 

#### WARREN

So, what do we do, he just needs more Eterniteze right? Bryony came here as a wild dog, and you managed to get her back to original flavour psychopath in a day, just whack up a drip and we're cooking.  

#### GRACE

Warren, I think you know that it is not that simple. No two emergences are the same. Bryony's treatment was rushed and, frankly, reckless. There was far more luck involved in the lead up to Gordon's emergence than I have cared to admit.  

#### WARREN

So, what are you saying? 

#### GRACE

I am saying it is not simply a matter of increasing the dose of Eterniteze. Successful cryonic preservation requires some major altering of human brain chemistry. This is related to the neurological changes that occur when someone experiences severe trauma. You know this.  

#### WARREN

It sounds so dumb when you just say it like that. 

#### GRACE

I know. But successful emergence from hypersleep is dependent on managing those neurological changes. We don't just have to have the correct medication, we have to identify the correct regimen, adapt and adjust, trial and error, sometimes over a long period -  

#### WARREN

Yes, yes. I'm sure it's extremely hard. 

#### GRACE

It really is, you know. And for Gordon, we are facing a more challenging recovery than most. The injury he sustained, the unknowns around his infusion, the circumstances he's emerged into... The symptoms he's displayed are not surprising - in fact I'm almost relieved they are not worse - but they are very real and need to be taken seriously. 

#### WARREN

Are you implying that I'm not? 

#### GRACE

No, not at all. I only feel it important to be realistic about his recovery. 

#### WARREN

But when I came out I -  

#### GRACE

With respect. Gordon is not you. In fact when it comes to any aspect of cryonic preservation, no one is like you.  

##### [PAUSE]

Which brings me to my next point. 

#### WARREN

Well, that's your ominous voice. 

#### GRACE

It comes with age. You need the gravel in the back of your throat.  

#### WARREN

What's the problem, Grace? 

#### GRACE

Even if it was simply a matter of increasing Gordon's dosage of Eterniteze, we'd still be in trouble. Our supplies are dwindling. 

#### WARREN

You had a delivery the other week. I don't even need to take it anymore – 

#### GRACE

As I said. Everyone's needs are different. I did 5 years in a cryopod 30 years ago, I don't need it anymore either. But Gordon will need it the rest of his life. So will Bryony, so will Aubrey, and others at the station too. Given the Bastion's attitude to all things hypersleep, this medication is hard to produce and even harder to procure. And now Overhead know we're at Red Valley, and that we have Bryony... we cannot stay here forever. Which will make it very hard indeed to secure supplies. 

#### WARREN

This sounds not good. 

#### GRACE

Well, I've had an idea. But I don't like it. 

#### WARREN

The gravel's really working today, Grace. 

#### GRACE

The day Gordon emerged he needed a significant amount of your blood in order to survive. The chemistry is... er… complicated, but put simply, your blood is full of the ingredients required for successful hypersleep, thanks to the combination of your own genes and er… everything Bryony put you through all those years ago. It gave Gordon what his body needed for survival. It's taking a while to figure out exactly how that worked, but we are getting there. 

#### WARREN

I think I can see where you're going with this. 

#### GRACE

I thought you might. Warren, I believe we may be able to synthesise our own Eterniteze. But we'd need... what we need is... 

#### WARREN

Me. You want me to do tests and samples and science shit, right? 

#### GRACE

...Right.

#### WARREN

That's fine.  

#### GRACE

Warren, I do not take the notion lightly -  

#### WARREN

I know. And that means a lot. But seriously. It's fine. It's going to help Gordon, right? 

#### GRACE

It could help a lot of people.  

#### WARREN

Well, great. Let's do it. Let's get started. 

#### GRACE

There is no need to rush. I did not assume your cooperation, we'll draw up a care plan. 

#### WARREN

Sure. Bend me shake me, any way you want me.  

#### GRACE

Believe me, this time it would be different. 

#### WARREN

Well, Jesus I hope so! You don't need to be my secret wife, do you? 

#### GRACE

Hopefully not. 

##### [PAUSE]

But you could do worse. 

#### WARREN

I was about to say that.

##### [GORDON LIES IN BED, SEDATED BUT CONSCIOUS]
##### [HE IS A LITTLE WOOZY - NOT A FAMILIAR FIT FOR GORDON]
##### [WARREN SITS BY HIS BEDSIDE, GORDON STIRS]

#### GORDON

Hey.

#### WARREN

Hey.

#### GORDON

You know I don’t think I can get used to this.  

#### WARREN

You in the bed, me in the chair? 

#### GORDON

Yeah. It’s very weird.  

#### WARREN

Yeah, it is. So, how was it? 

#### GORDON

How was what? 

#### WARREN

Going to see Bryony. Losing your shit a little bit.  

#### GORDON

I did not ‘lose my shit.’ 

#### WARREN

You called her Paper Mario.  

#### GORDON

I don’t even remember that. I suppose the robot told you.  

#### WARREN

Yeah. Anyway man, you want to do stuff like that, next time you just call me, alright?  

#### GORDON

I was fine on my own, I’m not an invalid.  

#### WARREN

Oh, not for support. For fun. I could rustle up a golf club or something, we could go at it proper. Really fuck shit up.  

#### GORDON

It didn’t feel fun.  

#### WARREN

Ergo, call me next time.  

#### GORDON

It’s so strange. That we’re all still here. So much death in this place. But we’re all still here. All our brains held together with sticky tape, our bodies hobbling down corridors, with numb fingers and toes, or hair burned off, an arm missing, or old, and bitter, or...  

#### WARREN

Handsome and winning, like me. 

##### [EVEN IN HIS DOZY STATE, GORDON IS QUICK TO BE RILED UP BY HIS FRIEND’S NONCHALANCE]

#### GORDON

Will you just take something seriously, Oscar!  

##### [HE CATCHES HIMSELF THE MOMENT HE SAYS IT]
##### [HE IS ANNOYED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT MAKES HIM LOOK]

Warren, I mean. Obviously.  

#### WARREN

It’s no worries.  

#### GORDON

Don’t make a thing of it, it was just a mistake, I’m tired -  

#### WARREN

No one’s making a thing.  

##### [GORDON SIGHS, FRUSTRATED]

You need to sleep.  

#### GORDON

Yeah. More sleep. 

#### WARREN

And then we’re going to go to the chilled out choir band super laid back rehearsal thing tonight.  

#### GORDON

I don’t think I want to go -  

#### WARREN

Well, I am going to go because it’s Christmas. I would love to see you there.  

#### GORDON

I’ll think about it.  

#### WARREN

That’s all I ask.

_In the bleak midwinter
Frosty wind made moan
Ballbag hard as iron
Water like a stone
Snow had fallen snow on snow,
Snow on snow,
In the bleak midwinter
Long ago_

#### GORDON

Sorry. Hey. 

#### WARREN

Hey! You made it.  

#### GORDON

Yeah, I made it.  

#### WARREN

Can you… Can you get in alright -  

#### GORDON

Yeah, yeah, I’m fine. I just… I don’t really need this crutch anymore.  

#### WARREN

Yeah, you probably shouldn’t be carrying the girl at the same time -  

#### GORDON

I’ve got her. 

#### WARREN

Just let me… let me take her. 

#### GORDON

No, no… You take the crutch, I’ll take the tortoise. 

#### WARREN

No, that’s not very - fine. Whatever. 

##### [GORDON SITS DOWN HEAVILY]

What a palaver. 

#### GORDON

Yeah.

##### [WAFFLES SOUNDS A NOTE OF AGREEMENT]
##### [THEY BOTH SIT QUIETLY FOR A MOMENT WHILE THE MUSIC PLAYS]

Fine. You were right. This is quite nice, isn’t it? 

#### WARREN

It is. Makes me think of the kid in Home Alone going to that church and talking to the old guy with the shovel.  

#### GORDON

So, do I need to be worried about getting mobbed for autographs? 

#### WARREN

Nah. I’ve worked really hard at being socially awkward in all environments and time periods. People mostly leave me alone now. Enjoy this while you can.  

##### [PAUSE]

How are you feeling now? 

#### GORDON

Grace has assured me that what I'm going through is to be expected after everything my brain and body has been through, blah blah blah.  

#### WARREN

It's so tiring, isn't it? All the assurance. You want it, you kind of need it right, some explanation of what's happening, but it's all so complicated - 

#### GORDON

And ridiculous. Don't forget silly and ridiculous. 

#### WARREN

I don't know. I guess I've just found it easier to switch off a bit. To put myself in their hands.  

#### GORDON

Also ridiculous. 

#### WARREN

Fair.

#### GORDON

But also complicated.

##### [PAUSE]

#### CHOIR

_Stasis will not hold us
Neither ice sustain
In the hills and valleys
We are free again
In the bleak midwinter
Come unto this place
You will find your shelter
In the arms of Grace_

#### GORDON

I don’t remember these being the lyrics. I don’t feel free, do you Waffles? I can't really put myself in anyone's hands. That's not how I've operated. Historically. 

#### WARREN

I know. 

#### GORDON

So, Oscar was this guy I used to work with. When I first got into all this mess. 

#### WARREN

I know.

#### GORDON

You know?

#### WARREN

Yeah. When I was locked up in quarantine, I kind of listened to your... memoir.  

#### GORDON

Oh what, how did you? - oh not Gord. 

#### WARREN

I think it was Aubrey's idea to let me hear it but yes, Gord was kind of my guide. 

#### GORDON

Something needs to be done about this robot before I lose my mind, Warren. It’s so weird. 

#### WARREN

Oh! Oh! I forgot. Where's a - oh!  

##### [HE WOLF WHISTLES, A BLUE SKY DRONE FLOATS OVER]

Over here! Another early Christmas present. 

#### GORDON

What did you do? 

##### [BLUE SKY SPEAKS WITH THE DEFAULT VOICE OF REBECCA LANDRY]

#### BLUESKY

Hello Gordon.

#### GORDON

Oh thank God.  

#### WARREN

I thought you'd be happy. 

#### BLUESKY

Am I better placed now to be that serviceable pair of socks, do you think? 

#### WARREN

What? 

#### GORDON

Don't worry about it. 

#### BLUESKY

At least I can say 'posit' now without fear of judgement. 

#### WARREN

Er… I don't like that you guys have your own private jokes. Away with you. Go. 

##### [HE BATS THE DRONE AWAY]

#### BLUESKY

Feliz Navidad. 

##### [THE DRONES LEAVES]

#### GORDON

I never thought I'd be happy to hear that voice.

#### WARREN

Well, I’m glad. 

#### GORDON

I mean, if it was really trying to talk like me it would’ve said Feliz Natal cos that’s the Portuguese for Christm -  

#### WARREN

Dude.

#### GORDON

Sorry.

#### WARREN

It's okay.

#### GORDON

Look… it’s much better. I mean I still have strong opinions no matter what the voice is but at least it doesn’t make me think my conscience is talking to me.  

#### WARREN

Gord will be missed round here, so this does come with the caveat that you're going to need to start talking to people at some point. You know… to fill the void.  

#### GORDON

Oh please God, Warren tell me they haven’t all listened to my memoir too! 

#### WARREN

No, no, no, I checked. That was just for me. And Aubrey I assume, I think she's come to know as much about us as we know ourselves. 

#### GORDON

So weird.  

##### [PAUSE]

#### WARREN

So was Oscar... 

#### GORDON

Oh. No. No. It wasn’t like that. Like I said I don't really look for...That’s not what I want. He just... we connected. Over this stupid place at first, and then... he was a good man. I think. You may find this very hard to believe, Warren but I don’t make friends that easily.  

#### WARREN

It’s like looking in a mirror.  

#### GORDON

Anyway. I don’t know what you listened to. But he disappeared. I don’t know what happened to him.  

#### WARREN

I’m sorry. 

#### GORDON

It’s okay.  

#### WARREN

Yeah. I guess Red Valley got him.  

#### GORDON

Yeah. I guess it did.  

#### WARREN

Red Valley tried to get all of us.  

#### GORDON

It took some pretty good chunks out of us to be fair. 

#### WARREN

Did you really need your spleen? 

#### GORDON

I don’t know.  

#### WARREN

I don’t even know what a spleen does.  

#### GORDON

Grace tried to explain. I forgot.  

#### WARREN

They can take your spleen, but they can never take your freedom. Oh shit, sorry. 

#### GORDON

Yeah. Absolutely.  

#### WARREN

I am sorry I’ve been the way I’ve been. Since you came back. I do know how I’ve been.  

#### GORDON

Thank you for saying that.  

#### WARREN

I just... we got you back. And here you are, you’re in one piece, and I just didn’t want to see... I didn’t want to see the cost.  

#### GORDON

I get it.  

#### WARREN

I've been asked to help, a bit. With some of the science stuff.  

#### GORDON

Oh right. Help how? 

#### WARREN

They want to make their own meds, their own Eterniteze. So we're not so dependent on deliveries and stuff. So you can get the treatment you need. 

#### GORDON

What does that involve? 

#### WARREN

Special blood, special brain. I'm a special guy.  

#### GORDON

Warren - 

#### WARREN

Tests, scans, samples, things like that. Don't worry. It's not like before. 

#### GORDON

Okay. 

#### WARREN

Let's flirt with optimism. Dabble with hope. 

#### GORDON

I suppose it is Christmas. 

#### WARREN

What do you want to do tomorrow? 

#### GORDON

You’re not working a shift? 

#### WARREN

Hell no. Still no Nintendo? 

#### GORDON

I could tell you how to play Ocarina of Time or something.  

#### WARREN

I’m no good at that stuff. How about we play Russian Roulette with the dodgy dart guns? 

#### GORDON

I’m not having this conversation again -  

#### WARREN

Come ooon! 

#### GORDON

I do not want to shit myself! 

#### WARREN

We can put down towels or something! 

#### GORDON

What are you talking about! 

#### WARREN

Paralyse or pooalyse! 

#### GORDON

Shut up and listen to the music.  

#### WARREN

Fine.

#### GORDON

Fine.

#### WARREN

Merry Christmas, Gordon. 

#### GORDON

Merry Christmas.

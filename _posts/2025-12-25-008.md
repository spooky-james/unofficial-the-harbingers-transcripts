summary:         "On December 23rd, 2028, Adam Blackwell and Amy Stirling attended the same Christmas party in New York City. After a long, difficult year, they were both eager for a bit of fun and some time off. Little did they know, however, that chance encounters, long-awaited meetings, and dramatic revelations would all ensue in the course of just a few short hours - and that neither one of them would leave that party quite the same as they were when they got there."

##### [SKINNER FLIPS THROUGH A FEW PIECES OF PAPER]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Okay... and I think that brings us to Christmas. Specifically to... Christmas of 2028. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Mmm, yes. Of course. You want to talk about _the party_. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

If it wouldn’t be too much trouble... 

#### AMY STIRLING

No, we can talk about it. Actually, you know what I would love? 

##### [TRANSITION SOUND]


------


##### [THE OFFICE SOUNDS CONTINUE, BUT WE ARE NOW WITH ADAM]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I’d love a chance to talk about what happened there. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

...you would? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yes, I would. Is - is that so surprising? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Well... you don’t want to talk about Amy Stirling, you don’t want to talk about April Fourth, you don’t want to talk about all the good press you got after April Fourth... 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yes, okay, yeah- 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

You don’t want to talk about the Doomscroller... 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Thank you, I get it. But no, this is different. You know why? 

##### [TRANSITION SOUND, WE ARE FLIPPING BETWEEN AMY AND ADAM'S INTERVIEWS]

#### AMY STIRLING

We were all there. I mean, almost. Doomscroller being Doomscroller, he _obviously_ wasn’t there. And our South American friend got held up with Christmas mass.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

But besides them? Everyone was there. All the pieces on the chessboard, together in one place. 

#### AMY STIRLING

It had been a long, long year. A lot of time on the road. The emergence of Three and Four.  

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

The end of Amy’s first big tour, November... the assassination attempt. 

#### AMY STIRLING

But somehow... it had all come together for a happy ending. At least... that’s what it felt like back then. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It was... the victory lap. Or maybe just the exhale after a sprint. 

#### AMY STIRLING

A chance to let our hair down for once! My hair was starting to get long at that point. Because I think, deep down?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

We all knew that 2029 was going to be even harder. And so... when I got the invitation in the mail, I thought... why not? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Rooftop gala, right off Forty-Second Street. Night before Christmas Eve. Open bar. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I - I’m hardly an authority on these matters, but... she knows how to throw a party. And well... when you put that many chemical elements in the same petri dish... sooner or later something’s bound to react. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

So... I think I’m hearing that we can talk about Christmas for a little bit? 

##### [AMY AND ADAM BOTH EXHALE]

#### AMY & ADAM

Yeah… let’s talk about Christmas.

##### [THE SOUNDS OF A PARTY AT A ROOFTOP BAR]
##### [VARIOUS PEOPLE CHAT AND MILL AROUND, JAZZY PIANO COVERS OF CLASSIC CHRISTMAS SONGS PLAY THROUGH SPEAKERS]

#### NARRATOR

New York City. December Twenty-Third, 2028. Two hours before midnight. 

##### [A FEW APPROACHING STEPS]

#### AMY STIRLING

Do my eyes deceive me, or is that Adam Fucking Blackwell at a party? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, what can I say...? Miracles have been known to happen at Christmas. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Well, in that case... Merry Christmas, Doctor. Here, cheers.

##### [SHE HANDS HIM A GLASS, THEN CLICKS IT TOGETHER WITH HER OWN]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Thank you. 

#### AMY STIRLING

No, but really, Doc, I’m surprised to see you here. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well... she invited me. And I suppose I did do... a little bit to help. 

#### AMY STIRLING

I suppose in your own very little, very terse way... you did.

##### [A PAUSE]

Umm, Adam, that was the moment when you were supposed to go - _[bad Adam imitation]_ “By the way, congratulations are in order. All the hard work you did paid off.” -[exaggerated version of herself]_ “Oh, stop, I just helped out here and there.” -[Adam again]_ “No, no, you were instrumental from day one.” _[herself]_ “Well, if you insist, I will begrudgingly allow you to spend the next thirty minutes telling me how awesome I am.” _[normal register]_ And scene. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It sort of feels like you don’t need me for this conversation. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Ehh, fair. You been okay, though? You send anything else to the moon lately? 

##### [A PAUSE, THEY BOTH LAUGH A BIT]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I can’t believe it took them that long to spot it. What happened to the days of humans looking up to the stars? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Mmm, blame Walker and his budget cuts, NASA is not what it once was. 

##### [THEY CHUCKLE A BIT MORE, THEN A PAUSE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I heard about Philadelphia. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Philadelphia was not my favorite. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You need to be careful, Amy. You might be making yourself too big, too visible. You can’t actually stop a bull- 

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh my god, take one night off, Adam. Have another drink. Go talk to a pretty lady in a slutty cocktail dress. After the business with the heart, I’m sure there’s at least one person here who’s a teleportation groupie. Have some fun for once, all right? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

We’re not rock stars, Amy. We have magic, powers that could change - 

#### AMY STIRLING

All right! I tried. I want the record to show: I tried. See you, Adam. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Amy- 

#### AMY STIRLING

I’m gonna go talk to the lady of the hour. Cheers. 

##### [FOOTSTEPS AS AMY WALKS AWAY]

Andie! Andie! 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Oh my god, Amy! 

##### [SHE TURNS TOWARDS SOME UNHEARD PARTY-GOERS SHE WAS TALKING TO]

I’m so sorry, excuse me, I just need to say hi to her for a moment, and - I’ll be right back- 

##### [SOME FOOTSTEPS AS SHE APPROACHES]

#### AMY STIRLING

_[whisper]_ Is that anyone important? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

_[whisper]_ So important and so rich and so boring, save me. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Okay, hang on… _Carilia Boren Koresh Gral._ 

##### [THE SOUNDS OF THE PARTY MOMENTARILY DROP OUT]
##### [A MAGICL CHIME GOES THROUGH THE AIR, THEN SOUNDS OF THE PARTY RETURN]
##### [FOOTSTEPS RUSH AWAY]

They won’t be sure why, but they are about to spend a very exciting half hour debating whether you can actually see the Empire State Building from this rooftop. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Oh my god, you psycho, I love you. 

##### [AMY BLOWS ANDREA A KISS: MWAH! THEY BOTH LAUGH]

#### AMY STIRLING

Guess that’s a thing I probably shouldn’t do once you take the new job, huh? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Yeah, probably not... I’m glad you were able to make it. I thought maybe you’d need to be in England by now. 

#### AMY STIRLING

I have a Christmas Day flight, actually. Boxing Day show at the Earl’s Court. I gotta make up the dates I canceled in the fall. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

You need some time off, Amy. You work too hard. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh, look who’s talking. When your next day off? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Don’t ask. 

##### [THEY BOTH CHUCKLE]

#### AMY STIRLING

I liked your speech by the way. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

You did not. It was basically a thesaurus session on different ways to say, “Thank you for all the money, please give me more next year.” 

#### AMY STIRLING

I thought you made it as scintillating as that material could ever be. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Yeah, yeah... You, uh, you talk to Adam yet? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Just did, actually. Thanks for inviting him and not giving me a head’s up, _by the way_. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

I’m a psycho and you love me. How’d it go?

##### [A PAUSE]

Don’t ask? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Yeah, don’t ask. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Okay. He sent your coffee to the moon, really? God, you two have the worst best fights. What happened to just pulling on someone’s pigtails? 

##### [AMY LAUGHS, VERY, VERY LOUDLY]

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh my god, that was - that was so loud... 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

nd what I said wasn’t even that funny... 

#### AMY STIRLING

No, I know. Just... god, I’ve been tense. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Yeah, girl. Someone trying to kill you tends to have that effect. 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### AMY STIRLING

It’s... it’s only going to get worse for the two of us, right? Going forward? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

...yeah. It’ll get worse. But we’re tough. We’ll get through it. And then it’ll get better.  

#### AMY STIRLING

Bring it on?

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Bring it on. 

#### ASSISTANT

Uhhh, Ms. Shepherd?

##### [ANDREA GROANS, ANNOYED, AMY CHUCKLES A BIT]

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Ugh. Okay, duty calls. Hang out for a bit, I’ll find you when I get a moment? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Sure. You’re awful, bye. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

You’re awful, bye. 

##### [AMY LAUGHS AS ANDREA WALKS AWAY, THEN, A NEW SET OF FOOTSTEPS APPROACH]

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Ms. Stirling. Merry Christmas. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Mr. Eckerberg. I didn’t know you were going to be here. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Don’t tell me you’re not happy to see me? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Of course not. It’s always nice to run into a... _friend_. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

After everything I did to help Ms. Shepherd, I didn’t want to miss out on the victory lap. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Of course not. Would you care for a drink? 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

A drink and a chance to catch up. Sounds terrific. 

#### AMY STIRLING

All right… _[under her breath]_ _Ryldra Carea Juren Nildro..._

##### [THE S0UNDS OF THE PARTY BECOME MUTED AS A MAGICL CHIME GOES THROUGH THE AIR]

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Tell me, Ms. Stirling, where is your tour going next? I have friends who have been trying to get tickets and... 

##### [THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES, SOFTLY AND OUT OF FOCUS, BUT OVER IT, SLIGHTLY ECHO-Y AND GHOSTLY WE HEAR THEM SPEAK]

I hope you’re very happy with the results. An outstanding outcome to all your hard work.  

#### AMY STIRLING

Yeah, I’m besides myself. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Is there a problem, Ms. Stirling? I know you won’t be mourning the Walker years. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Of course I won’t miss them, don’t insult me. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

I wouldn’t dream of it. But if not that, then what’s on your mind? 

##### [A SMALL PAUSE]

#### AMY STIRLING

You. You’re on my mind. I don’t like the way you’ve gone about things.

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Really? I thought you’d be thrilled. After all: I helped your friend. I paved the way for her, made sure she had everything she needed. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh yeah, including a world-famous superstar cheerleader to raise her profile when she needed it the most. And now Andie’s going to be in just the right position to do you a favor… you know, just between friends. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

We’ve all benefited greatly from our partnership. Why is that a bad thing?  

##### [SOMEWHERE AROUND THEM THERE'S A CRASH AND THE SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS, WHICH MAKES ALL THE OTHER SOUNDS OF THE PARTY COME RUSHING BACK, THEY BEGIN TO SPEAK NORMALLY AGAIN]

#### AMY STIRLING

Ooops, uh, party foul. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Some people just can’t hold their eggnogg, I suppose. Anyway, as I was saying - if you really want to maximize attendance for your tour... 

##### [AGAIN THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES BUT THE SOUNDS OF THE REAL WORLD FADE DOWN]

#### AMY STIRLING

It’s a bad thing because you used her. You used both of us. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

And you haven’t used me? Remind me: who footed the bill for your first shows? Who paid for your publicist, for that first big profile of you in In Depth? Hmm? We all use each other. To great benefit. 

#### AMY STIRLING

I… I just don’t like feeling like a piece on a chess board. That’s all. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

We’re all pieces on chess boards, Ms. Stirling. Only now... we’re on the winning side. 

#### AMY STIRLING

We better be. Anything else I can do for you… friend? 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Yes, there is. Your counterpart is being exquisitely stubborn. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Adam? Stubborn? Who could have possibly seen that coming…? 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

I suppose you did warn me before the first time I spoke to him, yes. And we’ve all had other things on our minds these past few months. But after our recent victories, things should start coming together... and all I want for Christmas is a way to make Dr. Blackwell come around. 

#### AMY STIRLING

’m just a witch, Mr. Eckerberg, not a miracle worker. You’re… very sure that it has to be Adam? Damián might be easier to- 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

No. We’ve studied the matter quite extensively. Out of the four of you, Dr. Blackwell’s powers are best suited for what we’re trying to do with Athena. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Well... I’ll keep thinking about it. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Please do. Thanks to you and Miss Shepherd, we have the chance to actually do some good these next few years. I’ll be in touch about some projects we’ll be tackling together in the new year. 

#### AMY STIRLING

I cannot wait... 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

We can go back to just one conversation now, thank you. 

#### AMY STIRLING

_Eryldra..._ 

##### [ANOTHER MAGICL CHIME AND ALL THE SOUNDS OF THE PARTY RETURN TO NORMAL]

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

...quite a different experience from traveling in America, at least that’s what I’ve found. Oh, but I’ve taken up so much of your time. I’m so sorry, I do sometimes go on and on. 

#### AMY STIRLING

It’s quite all right, Mr. Eckerberg, it’s - all right. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Still... I’ll leave you to the party now. Always good to see you, Ms. Stirling. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Absolutely... always nice to catch up with a friend. 

##### [AMY TAKES A SIP FROM HER DRINK, THEN TAKES A FEW STEPS AWAY FROM ECKERBERG]

All right. Whatever. Shake it off. Just... 

##### [SHE TAKES A DEEP BREATH]

Just... motherfucker! 

##### [FOOTSTEPS APPROACH AND STOP RIGHT IN FRONT OF AMY]

#### MAN

Okay, I see we’ve reached that portion of the evening. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh my god, sorry, I just... Oh my god, you’re... you. Oh my god, you’re you and I am getting to meet you and I am being like seven kinds of a mess right now, what the fuck? 

#### MAN

It’s all right, it’s all right, it happens. As long as you don’t get to nine kinds of messy, we’re fine. 

#### AMY STIRLING

No, it’s just - that’s very nice of you, but - umm, hi? What the hell? It’s very nice to meet you? 

#### MAN

It’s very nice to meet you too. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Uh, I’m - I’m Amy. Amy Stirling. 

##### [SHE WIPES HER HANDS ON HER CLOTHES, HOLDS IT OUT TO HIM FOR A HANDSHAKE]

#### MAN

I know who you are, Miss Stirling. 

#### AMY STIRLING

I’m the Silver Witch, I have this thing where I can and my brain is only now catching up to you saying that you know who I am. Very good, cool, great, have we gotten to eight kinds of messy now? 

#### MAN

Call it seven and a half. But really, it’s a good night for messy.

##### [A PAUSE]

This is a weird party.

#### AMY STIRLING

 This is a weird fucking party! There’s so many... _people_ people here. 

#### MAN

I just spent twenty minutes talking to a nice lady who turned out to be the French ambassador to the US. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Yeah, on the way up here, I shared an elevator with two guys from the Knicks. 

#### MAN

Have you run into Emily Morrison yet? She’s around here somewhere. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Excuse me? Emily Fucking Morrison, are you for real? Oh my god… Oh my god, wait, what am I saying? Have you met Adam yet? Adam Blackwell? Because he’s around here- 

#### MAN

I - know. I did. I just managed to steal five minutes of his time. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Okay. Good! And, uh, how’d it go? How was he? 

#### MAN

He was... kind. Polite. Very nice. And, umm... 

#### AMY STIRLING

He had no idea who you were, did he? 

#### MAN

He had no fucking idea who I was, no. 

##### [AMY AND THE MAN BOTH LAUGH]

#### AMY STIRLING

God, Adam... 

#### MAN

It’s fine. Honestly, it was kind of refreshing. 

#### AMY STIRLING

You actually mean that? 

#### MAN

Oh, no. Nobody’s ever actually meant that one. But it’s what you’re supposed to say. 

##### [AMY LAUGHS AGAIN]

#### AMY STIRLING

Jesus. 

#### MAN

But still... it was nice to meet him. Thank him. Shake his hand.

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh, careful. Don’t inflate his ego too much, some of us have to work with him. 

#### MAN

He was all right and nothing more. Aggressively fine. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Yeah, that’s better. Well, umm, now that you’ve met him, you should... come by one of my shows sometime. See what I can do. You know, compare and contrast, and... wait, what am I doing? You’re - you’re being very nice. But I don’t want to - you’ve probably got like a million other people to talk to and stuff to do, and... if you’re done being polite, you don’t have to stay here and keep talking to me, all right? 

#### MAN

Yeah, all right. I don’t have to stay here. Understood.

##### [A LONG PAUSE]

#### AMY STIRLING

...you’re not going anywhere. 

#### MAN

Yeah, I know. 

#### AMY STIRLING

...okay. 

#### MAN

And for the record... I know who you are, Miss Stirling, because I’ve already seen your show. 

#### AMY STIRLING

...have you?

#### MAN

Yeah. Three times. 

#### AMY STIRLING

...you should call me Amy.

#### MAN

Amy. Okay then. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Yeah, okay. Want to... get a drink and then maybe you can... tell me what you thought about the show? 

#### MAN

And then maybe we can go see if we can get you Emily Morrison’s autograph? How does that sound? 

##### [AMY CHUCKLES A BIT]

#### AMY STIRLING

That sounds really… really great. Lead the way. 

##### [FOOTSTEPS AS THEY WALK AWAY TOGETHER]

#### NARRATOR

New York City. December Twenty-Third, 2028. An hour and fifty-seven minutes before midnight. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, we’re not rock stars, Amy. We have magic, powers that could change- 

##### [IT'S THE SAME BIT OF CONVERSATIONS WE HEARD EARLIER, WE SEEM TO HAVE GONE BACK IN TIME A BIT]

#### AMY STIRLING

All right. I tried. I want the record to show I tried. See you, Adam. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Amy- 

#### AMY STIRLING

I’m gonna go talk to the lady of the hour. Cheers. 

##### [FOOTSTEPS AS AMY WALKS AWAY, ADAM LETS OUT A BREATH, ANNOYED]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well... that went well. For about forty-two seconds...  

##### [ADAM TAKES A SWIG FROM HIS DRINK]

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Dr. Blackwell! 

##### [FOOTSTEPS AS ECKERBERG WALKS TOWARDS HIM]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Mr. Jerome Eckerberg. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

I was _so_ hoping I’d see you here. Merry Christmas. 

##### [THEY SHAKE HANDS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, Season’s Greetings. I didn’t know you’d be here. Are you... are you one of the donors? 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Indirectly. I helped out with some of the miscellanea here and there. Just enough to get the pity invite to her Christmas party. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And here I was thinking I was the pity invite. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Nonsense. What you did back in April was the first pebble of the avalanche. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, well... that was a one-time deal. I’m happier sticking to the sidelines. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Oh, come on. You’re going to tell me you didn’t enjoy being the hero of the day even a little bit?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What I am going to tell you, Mr. Eckerberg- 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Wait, wait- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

—is that no, I’m still not going to help you with your energy project.

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

At least come by Boston. See the facilities. Let us explain what we could do together. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

So you keep saying in your phone calls, and the letters, and the - 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Hey, a man’s got a right to ask, doesn’t he? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

He does... as long as he’s okay with getting “no” for an answer. 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

You really are content to just... sit and research your dead languages, aren’t you? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I really am. If you want a magician that gets involved in the issues of the day - go talk to Amy Stirling. 

##### [FROM THE DISTANCE, WE HEAR A BURST OF LAUGHTER FROM AMY - THE SAME WE HEARD EARLIER DURING HER CONVERSATION WITH ANDREA]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Just follow the sound of mocking laughter, you can’t miss it. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

I really think you should reconsider... 

##### [ADAM TAKES A DRINK]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Mr. Eckerberg... from what I understand, you’re about to get a bunch of the government money that Walker took out of clean energy right back in your pocket. I think your clean energy initiative’s gonna do just fine without Harbinger support artillery. Take the win. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Well, if you change your mind... 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

 Trust me. I won’t. Merry Christmas. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

And to you as well, Dr. Blackwell. 

##### [FOOTSTEPS AS ADAM WALKS AWAY FROM HIM, AFTER A MOMENT HE STOPS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Dewars on the rocks. Uhhm, make it a double, actually, please. 

#### MAN

Dr. Adam Blackwell! 

##### [THE MAN LAUGHS AS HE APPROACHES ADAM, EFFUSIVELY HAPPY]

It’s so, so good to meet you. I cannot - can I shake your hand? I’m going to shake your hand.

##### [HE TAKES ADAM'S HAND AND STARTS TO SHAKE IT]

Uh, it’s, uh, nice to meet you too? 

#### MAN

I cannot tell you how much this means. To get to thank you in person. Long overdue, I know, but... god, you wonderful man. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Th-thank you? 

#### MAN

I know, I know, they said that I should respect your privacy and your boundaries and that you really wanted to focus on your work and blah blah blah. But tell me that you at least got my letters. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I... yes, of course. 

#### MAN

Good. Good. And the gifts? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

The - the gifts were terrific. They were so... they were just wonderful. 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### MAN

You have no idea what the fuck is happening to you right now, do you? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Not a clue, I’m so sorry. 

##### [THE MAN LAUGHS]

#### MAN

Ooo-kay. Well, let me give you back your hand. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Thank you, yes, and- 

##### [ADAM TAKES A STEP AND KNOCKS INTO A TRAY, ITS CONTENTS FALL TO THE GROUND, CAUSING THE GLASS BREAKING SOUND WE HEARD EARLIER]

...shit. Where did that tray come from? 

#### MAN

I think it had been there for a while. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Ah, fuck. 

#### MAN

Want to just make it all go... _woosh_? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, I better not... woosh it anywhere. I don’t want to just make it someone else’s problem. 

#### MAN

Ahh. Well, here - I’ll help you clean it up. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, umm, thanks. 

##### [THEY BOTH START TO CLEAN UP THE BROKEN GLASS]

And, uh, I’m sorry. About the whole... I’m living through a very, very strange couple of years. It’s a lot of people and I can’t always keep track of, uh, of everyone I’ve met since this whole thing started. 

#### MAN

Don’t worry about it.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

But, umm, thank you for the letters and the gifts, because, uh, I go through all of them and, uh- 

#### MAN

No, you don’t. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, I don’t. I get... so much shit from people. The university’s started to handle that for me. But I... I really appreciate the gesture. 

#### MAN

Of course. Well, take it from me, if you’re ever having one of those days where everything is just... black and pointless and overwhelming... go to wherever the university handles that shit for you. Read some of your fanmail. Not the online shit, the physical stuff that people make with their hands. It’ll make you feel like you can keep going. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

 Nah, that’s not... I don’t get letters like that. 

#### MAN

Like what?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Like... the people that write to me are scared religious fundamentalists who want to know if I’m here to herald the rapture. Or big corporations that want me to help them move oil from A to B. Or weird companies out in Japan that want me to help them advertise alcoholic lip gloss or some shit. I don’t get fanmail. 

#### MAN

I, uh, I don’t think that’s true, Dr. Blackwell. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No? 

#### MAN

Take it from... well, take it from a fan. And I don’t think that I’m the only one. Go find out where that office is sometime in the new year. I think you’ll find some very nice things waiting for you down there. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...what did your letters say? 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### MAN

Go look for it. When you get back to Chicago. You’ll know it when you see it, trust me. There - I think that about does it. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah. 

##### [THEY GATHER THE LAST OF THE BROKEN GLASS AND STAND UP]

 Well... thanks for the help with that. I owe you one. 

##### [THE MAN LETS OUT A SHARP LAUGH]

#### MAN

No. Trust me. You don’t. 

##### [THE MAN CLAPS ADAM ON THE BACK]

I’m gonna go look for some friends of mine, but... thank you. Seriously: thank you. And... Merry Christmas. 

##### [FOOTSTEPS AS THE MAN WALKS AWAY]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You too, man! Happy - whatever, holidays. _[lower, under his breath]_ What the fuck was that about...?

#### NARRATOR

An hour and a half later. 

##### [ADAM IS BY HIMSELF IN A QUIET CORNER OF THE PARTY, HE LETS OUT A LOW BREATH]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, man… I still can’t believe it. Oh, Laurel… ojala estuvieras aquí para ver esto. 

##### [SOME FOOTSTEPS APPROACH]

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

I was wondering where you were hiding. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Not hiding, no, just - just taking a moment to... breathe. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Mm-hmm. I thought maybe you’d left without saying hello. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, my understanding is that if I did that you could now have me hunted down like a dog. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Not for another five weeks, but on Day One? Like a dog. 

##### [THEY BOTH LAUGH A BIT, ANDREA HOLDS SOMETHING UP TO ADAM]

Speaking of breathing... have a cigarette with me? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, thank you. I’ve never smoked. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Adam... the President-Elect of the United States just asked you to have a cigarette with her. I can’t make it an official order just yet, but come the fuck on. Grow a pair and smoke this cigarette with your next commander in chief. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

As I was saying... yes, ma’am, madame president elect. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Good boy. 

##### [AS THEY TALK, ANDREA LIGHTS TWO CIGARETTES AND PASSES ONE TO ADAM]

You never know, you might develop a taste for it. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, that’s what I need. I never got your apology, by the way. The whole heart thing. You promised no one would know I was behind that. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Officially, I have no idea how that information got leaked to the public. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Uh-huh. And unofficially?

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

C’mon, man. I’m a politician. You really think I’m gonna make some magic happen to save a famous actor’s life and _not_ tell the world about it? 

##### [ADAM LETS OUT A LOW CHUCKLE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I suppose it was... horribly naive of me. But now... here you are. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Here I am. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

How are you feeling? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

How am I feeling it? I’m feeling like I’m a thirty-five year old black woman who’s about to take the biggest job in the world in a country that tends to really fucking punish people for all three things I just listed. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It’s scary? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Yeah. It’s scary. But... it’s not scaring me, you know? I can’t let myself be afraid of it. Instead I just need to be in a constant state of... “Bring it on.” Half the country hates me? Bring it on. The infrastructure is in ruins because of four years of Walker? Bring it on. Most corrupt supreme court in our lifetime? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Bring it on. Yeah. I get that. 

##### [ADAM TAKES A DRAG FROM HIS CIGARETTE AND IMMEDIATELY BREAKS INTO A COUGHING FIT, ANDREA LAUGHS]

Goddamn. I... I don’t know if these are for me, Madame President. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Don’t know how to smoke a cigarette? _Bring it on._ 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You sound like Amy. I’ll never understand how so much fight fits into such a tiny person. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

What are you talking about? The two of you are exactly the same. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What?

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Come on. If she’s the irresistible force, you’re the immovable object.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, sure... 

##### [A PAUSE, ADAM EXHALES]

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

All right. Seven months ago, you asked me what Amy said about you. Do you want to know? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I - I don’t know if I want to- 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Shut up, yes, you do, listen to your very wise president, okay? Amy... has spent what has honestly felt like a lifetime of the Earth telling me you’re stupid. And ridiculous. And cowardly. And sloppy, and arrogant, and-  

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

_[sarcastically]_ Boy, this is just what I wanted for Christmas, how did you know?

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

She’s only wrong about like half of those and you know it. But... the only reason why she’s even noticed all of that stuff is because... she thinks you’re worth paying attention to.

##### [ADAM SCOFFS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

If anything, too many people pay attention to me these days. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Oh sure. But Amy didn’t start paying attention when you became the Most Powerful Man in the World. Mmm. She started paying attention when you were just the weird guy in her grad school cohort who it was fun to argue with. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

She... she thought that was fun?

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

I don’t know. Maybe. Yes. Yes, she did. And I would bet all the money in my pocket against all the money in your pocket that so did you. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I... Look, we tried. I tried. I - I asked her out and we- 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Yes, yes, yes, I know. Believe me: _I know_. But the real problem wasn’t the date. The real problem is what you did afterwards. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What I - ? What did I do afterwards? I... I went back, I tried to... Oh. Oh. I won. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Mm-hmm. You “won”. This is... winning. But... might be time to let her have a rematch, don’t you think? Could be fun... You remember fun, right?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

W-why are you saying all of this? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Oh, I don’t know. Maybe it’s because in a month I’m gonna be too busy fixing other stuff to deal with your bullshit. Maybe I want some good karma before the end of the year. Maybe I just think that things might go better for everyone if the two of you actually got laid for once. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, whoa, what do you know about- 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Adam, please. I know. But mostly... I can’t spend the next four years dealing with Amy stewing about you. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Wait. Amy stews? About me? 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Officially I never said that. Unofficially- 

##### [SHE GIVES HIM A PUSH, THEN TWO MORE]

Get off the bench and go talk to her, for fuck’s sake. Okay? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Umm, I - well- 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

Go. That one’s order. Seek happy nights to happy days, all right?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Right. Yeah, sure! Umm… thank you. 

#### ANDREA SHEPHERD

You’re welcome. Merry Christmas. 

##### [FOOTSTEPS AS ADAM LEAVES ANDREA BEHIND AND HEADS TOWARDS THE THICK OF THE PARTY, WHICH GETS LOUDER]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Umm, Amy? Amy? Has anyone seen Amy? 

##### [MORE FOOTSTEPS AS HE WALKS THROUGH THE SPACE]

Fuck. Okay... 

##### [A FEW MORE FOOTSTEPS]

Amy? Amy? Where the fuck did you - ? Amy?! Has anyone seen Amy Stirling? The Silver Witch? Anyone? 

##### [THE SONG "YOU LOST YOUR WAY" BY WAYWARD DAUGHTER BEGINS PLAYING THROUGH THE PARTY'S SPEAKERS]

Goddammit! 

##### MORE FOOTSTEPS, THE CHATTER OF CONVERSATION GOES ON AROUND HIM]

Are you kidding - did nobody see where Amelia Stirling went? 

##### [FINALLY A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY FROM HIM]

#### AMY STIRLING

Dude... what the hell? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Amy. Where did you - ?

##### [SOME FOOTSTEPS AS ADAM CLOSES THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM]

#### AMY STIRLING

I was - I was just getting my coat. What’s the deal? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Umm, okay, it’s just... I - I - I was thinking and I just - Wait... coat? Are you - are you going? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Dude... what the hell? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Umm, yeah. This party’s fun, but it’s kinda giving me a headache... I think we’re gonna slip out and go have a quiet drink at my place.

#### AMY STIRLING

“We?” 

##### [A FEW FOOTSTEPS APPROACH]

#### MAN 

Dr. Blackwell. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, it’s - it’s you. 

#### AMY STIRLING

I, uh, I heard that the two of you met earlier? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, yeah, of course. I’m - I’m so sorry man, I just realized, I didn’t even get your name before. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Yeah, of course you didn’t. Adam Blackwell, allow me to introduce... Kris Middendorf. 

#### MAN

It’s nice to meet you. Again.  

##### [KRIS AND ADAM SHAKE HANDS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Umm... it’s... it’s a pleasure to - Oh. Oh my god. _Middendorf_. You’re - ?

#### KRIS MIDDENDORF 

Yes. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And so the reason you were - ?

#### KRIS MIDDENDORF 

Yes. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And you sent me letters because - ?
 
#### KRIS MIDDENDORF 

Yes. 

#### AMY STIRLING

And could we speed this up a bit? We’re trying to Irish Goodbye here. What did you want, Adam? 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I... Nothing. It’s nothing, Amy. I was just... I was just thinking… you’re right. I should take a day off. And I... umm, I thought I should tell you. That you were right. You were very, very right. 

#### AMY STIRLING

...yeah. Okay, you weirdo. I’ll take that. I guess. I... think maybe you’ve had enough to drink for tonight, okay, Adam? I’ll see you around. Merry Christmas. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, you too. 

##### [SOME FOOTSTEPS AS THEY DEPART]

#### KRIS MIDDENDORF 

Nice to meet you. And thank you. Again. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah. No... no problem. Again.

##### [THEY'RE GONE, THEN... ANOTHER FOOTSTEP APPROACHES ADAM]

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Everything all right, Dr. Blackwell? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

_[clearly not fine]_ Fine, Mr. Eckerberg. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Are you sure? Maybe you need a top-up? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, sure. Actually, no, I’m fine, but... Mr. Eckerberg... how’s your schedule in the first few weeks in January? 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

...adaptable. Why? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

 think maybe I should come by Boston. See what you’re trying to do. Maybe... I can help. Maybe it’s time I get off the bench. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Well, I’m thrilled to hear that. I’ll have my people set something up with your people. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Great. 

#### JEROME ECKERBERG

Dr. Blackwell. You’re not going to regret this. I think some... big, big things are coming this next year. Just you wait. 

#### SONG

_You'll be her summer, her winter, her lover, her friend_
_Her hero in the morning, her beginning, middle, end_
_But inside you would die to go back to the start_
_Because you lost your way_
_When you lost your place in my heart..._

##### [THE SONG ENDS]
##### [A LONG PAUSE]

#### ANNOUNCER

The Harbingers will return Valentine’s Day, 2026.

Today’s history tidbit: on December 25th, 1782, explorer Desmond Childers mysteriously vanished without a trace, less than twenty-four hours before he was scheduled to set sail on a new expedition to the South Indian Ocean.

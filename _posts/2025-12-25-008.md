episode_number:  '008'
summary:         "On December 23rd, 2028, Adam Blackwell and Amy Stirling attended the same Christmas party in New York City. After a long, difficult year, they were both eager for a bit of fun and some time off. Little did they know, however, that chance encounters, long-awaited meetings, and dramatic revelations would all ensue in the course of just a few short hours - and that neither one of them would leave that party quite the same as they were when they got there."

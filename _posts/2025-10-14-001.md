##### [A DOOR OPENS]

#### ERICA PFEIFFER

Ms. Skinner will be right with you, Dr. Blackwell. We’re sorry for the delay. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It’s fine. Don’t - don’t worry about it. 

#### ERICA PFEIFFER

Can I get you anything while you wait? Water, a cup of coffee?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I’m all right, Miss Pfeiffer, thank you.

##### [A PAUSE]

Was there something else? 

#### ERICA PFEIFFER

No, uum, that’s everything. Uhh... Thank you.

###### [AMOTHER PAUSE]

Well, actually... look, I just want to say, I know it probably feels like the whole world’s against you right now. But there’s people who... get what you did. And why you did it. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Thank you, Ms. Pfeiffer. I... appreciate you saying that. 

#### ERICA PFEIFFER

I mean it. If you hadn’t been there, if you hadn’t done what - they’re saying that it could have gotten so much worse than - 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It got bad enough, Ms. Pfeiffer. We... we let it get bad enough. 

#### ERICA PFEIFFER

I know, uh, I know. But... still. 

##### [A DOOR OPENS AND SOMEONE ENTERS]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Thank you, Ms. Pfeiffer - I think that’s more than enough. 

##### [SKINNER SHUTS THE DOOR]

#### ERICA PFEIFFER

Yes, ma’am. Is there anything - ?

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

I think we are all set. I’ll ring if we need anything. 

#### ERICA PFEIFFER

Yes. Ms. Skinner. Dr. Blackwell. 

##### [A DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES AS ERIC DEPARTS, SKINNER SITS DOWN]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Please excuse Erica, Dr. Blackwell. She’s a wonderful assistant, but unfortunately she’s still a bit...

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Naive? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Optimistic. Still a bit young and optimistic. I’ll fix that in due course. But in the mean time... welcome to Skinner, De Vries, and Wiseman, Dr. Blackwell. My name is Claudia Skinner, it’s a pleasure to finally meet you. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yes, same here. Thanks for making the time. You’re... young. Young to have your name on the side of the building, I mean. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Ahh. It’s my father’s name. He started the firm back in oh-four.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Ahh. And so you...

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Graduated summa cum laude from Brown and went on to get law degrees in both Cambridge, England, and Cambridge, Massachusetts? Absolutely. I assure you, Dr. Blackwell, you are in excellent hands. Do you have any questions before we get started?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yes. How much do you charge?

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

My fees are being taken care of, you don’t need to worry about that.  

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

That’s not what I’m asking, I’m asking... A personal injury lawyer is, what? Two-fifty an hour? Give or take? If I was trying to get a divorce, that’s four-hundred. It’s six-hundred an hour for an immigration attorney, and nine for the kind of lawyer I’d need if I had shot a man in Reno just to watch him die. So how much are you - with your Alexander McQueen suit and your name on the side of the building and your naive assistant you’re turning to the dark side - how much are you charging per hour to sit here and talk to me?

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

It’s more than any of the numbers you just quoted. I can say that much.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

How much more? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Dr. Blackwell, is there a reason you need to know this right now?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Is there a reason why you’re not just telling me? 

##### [A PAUSE, SKINNER TAKES A DEEP BREATH]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

You know, there’s this story my father used to tell his clients. He’d go... once upon a time there was a young scorpion, who wanted to cross a river. Unfortunately, he couldn’t swim. So he asked a passing turtle to carry him on his back. The turtle hesitated, but eventually agreed after the scorpion promised not to sting him. But, when they were halfway through the river, a terrible impulse fell upon the scorpion. He brought his stinger down and- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

—and as they both start drowning, the scorpion says, “Don’t look at me, it’s in my nature, and you knew I was a scorpion when you agreed to take me across the river.” Yeah, I know that one.

##### [A PAUSE]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Actually... as the scorpion’s stinger bounced harmlessly off the turtle’s hard shell, he found the other animal looking back at him over his shoulder. And the turtle just said, “Tell me: do you want to fuck around some more, or do you want me to get you across this fucking river?” That was a story about how sometimes you can just let people help you. 

 ##### [A PAUSE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

A frog. It’s usually... a frog when I’ve heard that story. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Well, let me assure you, Dr. Blackwell: you’re not dealing with a frog. And let me remind you: you are the center of an unprecedented disaster. One in which people died. The only reason you haven’t been charged with a hysterical number of criminal charges is because no one is quite sure of how the law interfaces with your unique circumstance. But the government’s catching up. They’re doing a congressional hearing, the kind that’s going to decide how a lot of laws are going to work in this country, and they have been kind enough to invite you to participate. And when I say “invite” I mean “subpoena.” This hearing is either going to go exceptionally well for you or it is going to lead to you being invited to see the inside of a courtroom in a trial which you will have no chance of winning. So finally, allow me to ask you: would you like me to get you across the river or would you prefer to fuck around some more? 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Let’s... let’s get across the river. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Let’s.

##### [SKINNER HITS A BUTTON, THE TAPE RECORDER STARTS TO RUN]

This is Claudia Skinner, handling case MGR-83-1. This is information/prep session number one. It is November seventh, 2030. Dr. Blackwell, just so we can get the formalities out of the way... could you please state your full name? As well as the capacity in which you are known as a public figure? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yes. My name is Doctor Adam Blackwell. And I... I am the first human being with real, scientifically confirmed magic powers. I am... the most powerful man in the world.

###### [THE THEME MUSIC FADES AWAY]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

All right,. Dr. Blackwell... Why don’t we start at the beginning? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Sure. I was born April fifteenth, 1998, in Portland, Oregon. The house where I grew up had yellow shutters and a white fence. The nursery was - 

##### [SKINNER CLEARS HER THROAT]

Oh, what? You’re allowed to be cute but I’m not, is that how it works? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

That is exactly how it works. Let me be more precise. You were a graduate student at Sinclair University in Chicago, yes? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yes.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

You were a masters candidate in the archeology program? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Technically in the anthropology department, but yes. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Why? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Why? Why did I want to study archeology? Is that relevant? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

It could be. If you chose to study archeology because it was your beloved father’s dying wish? Very relevant. If you were convinced there were ancient secrets buried somewhere out there that would help us fight the rise of fascism, absolutely. If you became an archeologist solely out of your deep-seated love for the films of the Indiana Jones series? That can stay between the two of us. 

##### [ADAM SCOFFS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I liked languages. I thought I was going to study linguistics and go on to work as a translator. But then, my second year in college I took an anthropology class and I just... fell in love. 

##### [A RUSTLE OF PAPER]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Yes, that would be... “From Rapa Nui to Harbingers: An Introductory Survey to the Forgotten Empires of the World.” Taught by Julian McCandless, who went on to be your mentor and chief dissertation advisor.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

That class changed my life. It showed me a new way of thinking about the world, taught me that- 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Tell me about Amelia Stirling. 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Amy... Ms. Stirling was another grad student at Sinclair. We started the masters program at the same time. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Did you think much of her? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Ms. Stirling was... brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. But she could be... stubborn. It could be... difficult to get a word in edgewise around her. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Would you call her a rival? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, well... here’s what you need to understand: if you were interested in the study of ancient cultures? That grad program at Sinclair was the place. It was one of the best funded programs, it had some of the best professors, some of the best opportunities. But there... wasn’t enough of all of the above to go around. Any time one of us got a research project approved or a seat on a field expedition - or even time with our advisors - we were taking it away from one of the other students. In as much as you could say it about me and Amy, you could say it about all of us. We were _all_ rivals. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And yet... you didn’t go on a date with any of the other students in the program, did you? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, come on. That’s in-bounds? How do you even know about that?

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

This isn’t the hard part, you know. Lord knows we haven’t gotten anywhere near the hard part. It’s all going to come out, Adam, and I’m going to be the friendliest person that’s going to ask you about it. So, pretty please: stop fucking around and answer the question. 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

One. I went on one date with her. I was twenty-six, and I thought it might be a good idea, and...

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Did you find her attractive?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

The Venn Diagram between the people who like Ms. Stirling and the people who like oxygen is very close to being a circle.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Dr. Blackwell-

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yes, I found her attractive. And we went out one time. It must have been... April of 2025. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And how did it go? What did the two of you talk about?

#### NARRATOR

Sinclair University. April, 2025. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Okay... did you know that right now on this planet there are seven people who could save the world? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Seven people who - what? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Seven people. All with the power to save the world.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Right. Well, common sense says that cannot possibly be true. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Ahh, and yet! 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And you’re not talking like... people with their fingers on nuclear buttons who are choosing not to press them, thus preventing any- 

#### AMY STIRLING

No, no, fuck that. That sucks. I’m talking active, “making things that are broken not be broken” saving the world. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

All right. I’m intrigued. Who are these seven real world superheroes? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Paul Berthold, Makoto Kamiki, Simon Godowksi, Jerome Eckerberg, Jacqueline Saint-Pierre, Carlos Luis Méndez, and Zakir Mujambar. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

The seven richest men in the world. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Six richest men and its richest woman, thank you very much. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, sure. And the way they save the world is - ?

#### AMY STIRLING

Simon Godowski has a net worth of two-hundred and ten billion. You want to know how much NGO’s estimate the yearly cost of ending world hunger would be? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

From the way you’re presenting that question, I’m guessing two hundred billion? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Nope. Way high. Conservative estimate? Ten billion a year. Easy. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What? That cannot possibly be true. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Extreme Poverty’s even cheaper. Threshold’s set at those living for three dollars and twenty cents a day. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

There’s people living - ? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Yes there are people living for three and twenty a day. Bumping approximately nine hundred million people up to that level costs about... one-point-eight billion. Chump change. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

How do you just know - ? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Clean water across the whole world? Fifty billion. Child health? About four-hundred dollars a year per child... call that another fifty billion. Homelessness is more complicated, but local experts estimate that thirteen billion would end homelessness in San Francisco. That’s not solving the issue globally, but- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, still, that’s a start. All of which begs the question... 

#### AMY STIRLING

...if there are people who have the ability to just snap their fingers and save the world, why is the world not saved? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I mean, besides the obvious reason. 

#### AMY STIRLING

It’s the whole - sorry, obvious - what obvious reason? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well, just because Jacqueline Saint-Pierre has a net worth of two hundred billion, it doesn’t mean she has it sitting in a bank somewhere. It’s in, like, stocks and bonds and company valuation. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Okay, sure, fine, but that’s a road-bump. If you have something worth fifty billion, theoretically you should be able to sell it and then you have fifty billion, yeah? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I’m sort of scared to disagree with you right now. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Good, that means my whole shtick is doing its job. But to get back to the real question: there is no fucking good reason. If someone has that much money, that much power, and there is so much broken in the world, they have a moral imperative to do something about it. So really, from a social, pragmatic point of view, I don’t think there’s a way to justify the existence of any of them.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

So we’re gonna eat the rich? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Just the seven richest. That’s all I’m asking. Let’s eat those seven people and feed the world.

##### [THEY BOTH LAUGH]

Holy shit. You put a beer and a half in me and I just - I went off on a whole thing. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It was very impressive. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Still though. Sorry, I... clearly don’t know how to do first dates. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It’s fine. How do you know all of this stuff?

#### AMY STIRLING

I like actuarial tables and I have a good head for numbers. Even when I’m outraged. No, especially when I’m outraged. 

##### [THEY BOTH LAUGH, THERE'S A PAUSE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

So... now what? 

#### AMY STIRLING

I was thinking... we’d finish these beers, settle up, and then I’d get you to walk me home. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You’d “get me” to walk you home? Would I have any say in the matter? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh, none whatsoever. I have very pretty eyes and I can make them get all big and round, so I can basically get people to do anything I want. Here, watch: _Pleeeeaaaase? _

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh my god. Put those away before you hurt somebody!

#### AMY STIRLING

It’s like a superpower. I’m basically a Batman villain.

##### [THEY BOTH LAUGH]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You know, there is an alternative.

#### AMY STIRLING

To you walking me home? Umm, because dude, I think you’re gonna want to—

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, I mean - no, I do want, just - how much would it cost to, say, fix climate change? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh. That’s a big one. Somewhere in the ball park of... seven hundred billion? A year?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well, see? There you go. If I was someone that wanted to solve climate change, but I only had two hundred billion... Wouldn’t the best, most ethical thing I could do with that money be to... well, turn it into seven hundred billion? 

#### AMY STIRLING

I mean... no. Not if you - like if you’re burning the world to get richer, that’s not going to solve-

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, of course not. I’m just talking in the abstract. This isn’t even- 

#### AMY STIRLING

Okay, good, because- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What you’re talking about obviously isn’t the- 

#### AMY STIRLING

Obviously? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, I just mean - this is all just a thought experiment. 

#### AMY STIRLING

But, but you can how this is a slippery- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No one person can actually stop the world from ending, that’s my- 

#### AMY STIRLING

No, I think someone could. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, maybe on like a Fritz Haber level, but in the real world- 

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh, I can’t wait to hear this-

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Would you just let me talk for a moment? I can see it. Is all I’m saying. I can see why someone might not immediately sink all their resources into solving one problem if there’s something bigger and more meaningful they can do later on. And therefore... I can see why we might want to give your - your evil seven or whatever a bit of latitude. That’s all I’m saying. 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### AMY STIRLING

You done? Cool. I’m gonna go home. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Amy, hang on- 

#### AMY STIRLING

Pro tip, dude? Next time you’re trying to pick up a grad school girl with tattoos and a shaved head? Playing devil’s advocate for the billionaire oligarchy is so not the move. See you. 

##### [AMY GETS UP FROM HER CHAIR AND STARTS TO LEAVE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You know, this is exactly why McCandless hasn’t approved any of your research proposals.

##### [AMY WALKS BACK TO ADAM]

#### AMY STIRLING

...what did you just say to me?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You know, your proposals? For the archives, for field work? You know how he keeps telling you to go back to the drawing board, to think bigger? This is why. You never look at the big picture, Amy. You always just... swing for the fences. And he knows it, and you know it. 

#### AMY STIRLING

And you... Adam Fucking Blackwell... are so afraid of taking any swing at _all_... that when your opportunity comes, you’re gonna let it sail past you. And you know it. 

##### [AMY WALKS AWAY, SLAMMING THE DOOR OF THE BAR SHUT AS SHE LEAVES]
##### [THE TRANSITION SOUND PLAYS AGAIN]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And would we consider this one of your more successful first dates? No, don’t answer that. 

##### [SHE FLIPS A PAGE]

Field work that year was in... Princess Elizabeth Land. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yup. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Which, just for the record is in... 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Antarctica. East Antarctica, to be precise. One of the flattest, most accessible parts of the continent.  

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And why did we want to go to this lovely place? 

##### [ADAM STARTS TO RIFLE THROUGH HIS POCKETS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well, umm, they call the Robinson Site. They’d found it a few years earlier, buried under the ice. Global warming and all. The remains of An-Serith.

##### [HE TAKES A CIGARETTE FROM A CARTON AND USES A LIGHTER TO GET IT GOING]

That’s, umm, one of the great Harbinger cities - constructed about four-thousand years B.C., according to the carbon testing. It was buried under nearly-

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Whoa, whoa, whoa, what is - what is this? What are we doing here? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What? Oh, come on. You’re my lawyer, I’m your client, it’s your office, and you’re still going to tell me I can’t smoke? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Company Policy. Apologies. Should I have Erica get you an ashtray? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, don’t bother, I’ll just...

##### [A RUSHING SOUND FOLLOWED BY A POP]

There. Happy? Oh shit. Sorry. I - it’s a habit by now. I... forget that it’s less fun for people now. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

It’s okay. It’s... okay. Where did you send it? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Away. Just... away. Shall we... ?

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Yes. Let’s. Umm, sorry, we were...  Antarctica. Dig site. Ruins. McCandless was putting together an expedition? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah. They’d been digging it up for a few years, which is really hard when half the year is freezing darkness. Before sunset the previous, umm, you know, April, they’d made a discovery. A crypt, or something like a crypt, something at the very bottom of the excavation. McCandless wanted to go check it out. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And you got to go? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And I got to go. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

But not Ms. Stirling? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

But not Ms. Stirling.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Mm-hmm. And I presume that’s where it happened? 

##### [SKINNER HOLDS UP A PIECE OF PAPER]

Right… December fifteenth, 2026. “The world continues to reel after last night’s announcement. What was supposed to be a simple archeological expedition to the Australian sector of Antarctica may instead be remembered as a turning point in Western Civilization. Following contact with the object now known as Article Zero, mild-mannered graduate student Adam Blackwell has been given the ability to freely relocate matter at will.“

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I don’t think the Times actually called me mild-mannered. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

No, that was just me having a bit of fun. You went to the South Pole, found a thing, and suddenly you can do magic? Am I getting that right? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Not just any thing. 

##### [A LOW HEAVY HUM]

This thing. Article Zero. A Harbinger ring of magic. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

But still... field trip, ring, boom, magic? That’s the broad strokes of the thing? What happened when you got back to America? What happened after you got superpowers?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

They’re not superpowers… I came home. Spent weeks going through tests. Until finally... they were satisfied. I really could do magic. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And after they let you go? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I went back. To a little thing called my life. Finished my dissertation. I graduated in the spring, started teaching at Sinclair in the fall. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Is that usual?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

To get hired that fast? No. I was an exceptionally strong student, I had a good relationship with the head of the department, and news had just broken that I could do fucking magic. Having me as an adjunct was the best and last ad Sinclair would ever need to run. So they had me as an adjunct. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

That first fall semester, you took over one of the survey classes. “Introduction to Harbinger Linguistics.” Catchy title. Was it popular?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

The last time they’d run it, there were four people in the class. That fall, after they saw the enrollment forms, they moved me over to Sumpter Hall. That’s where they run movies on the weekends. It seats just shy of three-hundred and fifty. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

You taught a three-hundred and fifty person class on the mechanics of dead languages from six thousand years ago? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, no, no, no. The class was four-hundred and fifty. If you didn’t get there early, it was standing room only. 

##### [ANOTHER TRANSITION SOUND]

#### NARRATOR

Sinclair University. September, 2026. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Now, the name “Harbingers” is what is known as a secondary observer exonym. With some ancient cultures, we have some record of what they called themselves. Failing that, we can usually at least call a people by the region they inhabited. These people lived in the Indus Valley, so let’s take a wild leap and call them the Indus. Not saying that’s a good practice, but it is a common practice. Now with the Harbingers, you run into problems. We haven’t found any records yet that point to what they called themselves. And as for geography... sites containing written records in the Harbingers’ languages have been found in Atacama in South America, in remote islands in the South of Oceania, and, most recently, in rural Ireland. They seemed to mostly exist to make historians’ lives difficult.

##### [PERIODICALLY CLICK OF A SLIDE PROJECTOR THROUGHOUT]

It was actually one of the great mysteries of the Age of Exploration. People would sail from place to place and find these... ancient objects, with languages that weren’t the ones spoken by the locals. Now, imagine: you’re a Seventeenth Century Irish sailor, you leave your little village where (putting on an Irish accent:) Old Man McDonald found those spooky rocks with the strange carvings. (Back to his regular register:) You sail halfway around the world, and what do you find? More old spooky rocks with the same weird language nobody understands. Can you even imagine what they must have thought of that? 

##### [A PAUSE, HE ADVANCES THE SLIDE PROJECTOR]

Umm, in any case, they kept finding these really old artifacts all over the world, almost like this... really old culture had been around before everyone else got their act together. That’s where the name came from. Harbingers. Ones who came before. It wasn’t until the age of Antarctic exploration began in earnest that the real ruins of what is now known as the Harbinger Empire were discovered. But by then, the name had stuck, what are you gonna do?

##### [A PAUSE]

Now, I did say Harbinger languages in the plural. The modern theory is that these are actually contemporary languages - one was used for day-to-day activities, your regular “please pass the salt” sort of things. The other one was their... well, sacred is a loaded word, but their... ritualistic language. It was only used for rites and special activities. For a long time archeologists referred to these as the day tongue and the night tongue, but a more accurate translation would be... the Language of the Sun and the Language of the Stars. And, uh, needless to say, there’s a lot more that the Harbingers wrote in the Language of the Sun, so we know comparatively very little about how the Language of the Stars worked. 

##### [A PAUSE]

Okay, this - we’ve only got a few minutes left. So we’ll call this good for today, rather than diving into a whole other topic. Does anybody have any questions? 

##### [A LOT OF HANDS RISE SIMULTANEOUSLY]

Any questions that... don’t have to do with my unusual abilities?

##### [A LOT OF HANDS GO DOWN]

Yeah... all right. Everyone, I need you all to understand: this is a serious class, okay? I take the academic study of Harbinger languages seriously, and I expect you to do the same. Anything else that I can do... that’s not really what we’re here for, okay? 

##### [A PAUSE]

...which is why we’re only going to do this once, okay? 

##### [APPLAUSE FROM STUDENTS]

Just a quick demonstration and then we’re done, all right? Folks in the front row... anyone have a quarter? You do? Okay, great. Thank you very much. Okay, just so we know that I’m not pulling a fast one on you... I’m just going to take this marker and put an A on one side of the coin and a star on the other side, okay? 

##### [THE SOUND OF THE MARKER WRITING ON THE COIN]

Now, for most of human civilization, if we wanted to transport an object from here to there, we had to expend energy to move it across space. Whether it was by carrying it ourselves or... 

##### [ADAM FLIPS THE COIN AND CATCHES IT]

By using a burst of kinetic energy to set it in motion on its own. What I can do... is transport matter from A to B without crossing the intermediary space. Okay, everybody ready? I think we’re gonna hear it more than see it, with something this small, so shush shush shush shush. Here we go: three, two... 

##### [A PAUSE, THE SIMILAR SOUND OF THE WORLD FALLING AWAY AS ADAM SPEAKS]

_Berum laro iora kata. _

##### [A FAINT POPPING SOUND, FOLLOWED BY THE CLATTER OF A COIN]
##### [A STUDENT GASPS]

Okay, let’s see... Where’d it land? From the sound I think it was around the second to last row, maybe? Does anybody... yeah, you got it? And it’s got the A and the star, yeah? 

##### [A STUDENT LAUGHS AS SHE SPEAKS]

#### STUDENT

Yeah! 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well, there you go: A to B in an instant.

##### [THE ROOM BURSTS INTO APPLAUSE]

Now, now... how did I do that? Part of it is just mental focus. Part of it is the words. This, it seems, is what the Language of the Stars actually was, the Harbingers’ way of channeling this ability. And part of it is... the part we don’t understand yet. I found this ring in a very old, very remote part of the world. And as long as I’m wearing it... well, it seems to let me do that. And it really seems like it takes all three, so, uh, in case the course catalogue didn’t make this clear, learning the words won’t let you move things across space. Not on its own.

#### STUDENT

Could you do something bigger? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What was that? Could I transport something bigger? Bigger like what? 

#### STUDENT

A person! 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

A person? Well, uh, a person’s tricky. Because... what’s a person? Is a person one thing or many? Like, what if I transported you to the middle of the quad and you went but your... but your clothes didn’t? 

##### [SOME LAUGHTER]

Yeah, that’s not what we want. I have to be very precise with the language. If I want to do it right. All right. That’s time. Time was a minute or two ago, actually. Please read chapters three and four of the Warner and I’ll see you all here on Thursday.

#### NARRATOR

Sinclair University. 2026. Ten minutes later. 

##### [ADAM EXHALES]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

All right... that wasn’t too bad. One session down... thirty-one to go. 

#### AMY STIRLING

What did you stop yourself from saying? 

##### [A PAUSE, FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well, well, well... Amy Stirling.

#### AMY STIRLING

Adam Blackwell. It’s good to see you.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You too, Amy. Did you watch - ?

#### AMY STIRLING

I snuck in the back about five minutes in. So? What did you stop yourself from saying? C’mon. At the end. When they asked you about teleporting a person. You bit down on something. You said, what if you go but your clothes don’t. What did you _almost_ say? 

##### [ADAM EXHALES]

I almost said... what if you went... but your skin didn’t?

#### AMY STIRLING

Ah. Lively. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I thought... it’s gonna be a whole thing, it’s their first day. I didn’t want to freak them out. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Mmm, didn’t want to put too much of the fear of you in them?  

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Very funny, Amy. So what brings you around these parts? They said you’d transferred. 

#### AMY STIRLING

They said the truth. Took my business to Columbia. The Big Apple. Greener pastures and all that.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And are they actually greener? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Ehh, who knows. Kinda hard to tell with all the concrete. I’m just here to handle some paperwork and take some meetings, I’m flying back tomorrow. But I realized I hadn’t seen you since- 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Ahh. Sure. 

#### AMY STIRLING

And I couldn’t resist poking my head in here, seeing how your class was going. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

How’d I do? Any notes?

#### AMY STIRLING

It was fine. Your fourth slide had some photos of the stuff they dug up at the Riemann, that’s still not verified. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, dammit. Ahh, I’ll take care of that. Anything else?

##### [A PAUSE]

What? What else? You’re... you’re not really here to fill out paperwork, are you, Amy?

#### AMY STIRLING

...nah. I just... I had to see it. I had to see it with my own two eyes. You can do fucking magic and you are... you are lecturing... about carvings in goddamn rocks. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yes, Amy, I am. 

#### AMY STIRLING

I cannot believe you are lecturing about carvings— 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And what should I be doing? Hmm? Instead of being here, where am I supposed to be right now, Amy? Or what, am I not doing enough with my platform for you?  

#### AMY STIRLING

“We are fifty-four days away from the mid-term elections, Dr. Blackwell. Which political party do you support?” 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay. It’s nice of you to drop by, Amy, I enjoy our little talks. 

#### AMY STIRLING

It’s just - I - Fuck. I don’t know what you should be doing. But dude... you can do magic. Literally the only thing that’s a wrong answer to the question, “What do you do if you get magic powers?” is “Exactly the same fucking thing you would be doing if you didn’t get the goddamn magic powers!” 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

All right, Amy. This has been fun. Let’s get together again the next time one of us develops magical abilities. In the meantime: have a good time at Columbia, where you’ll also be looking at carvings of rocks.

#### AMY STIRLING

You are such an asshole, Adam. No one - no one - has ever changed the world by sitting in an ivory tower. Magic is wasted on you. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And yet... I’m the only one that can do it. It really is a shame you didn’t get to come on that expedition, Amy. What could have been, right?

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

She has a point, you know. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

She very much does not.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

She does, though. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Aren’t you my lawyer, what are you - why are you - a point about what? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

A point about how nobody has ever changed the world by hiding in the ivory tower of intelligentsia.  

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh for god’s - ! Fritz Haber. Do you know the story? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Excuse me? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay, Fritz Haber. See, a lot of people have this mistaken idea that the apocalypse is something we’ve only had to worry about in recent years. But no, actually, people have had concerns - very valid concerns - about the world coming to an end at practically every point in human existence. In the nineteen-hundreds, you know what was at the top of the list of global concerns? Starvation. The world had reached an absolutely massive population - one and a half billion people - and we could not produce enough food to feed them. The problem was our crops - they took up too much of the nitrogen in the soil, and it took too long to replenish it. So it was estimated that over the course of the following twenty agonizing years, two thirds of the world would starve to death. Ahh, but see, there was this guy. German chemist, called Fritz Haber. Big thinker, real kind of ivory tower guy. He locked himself in his lab, and figured out a way to make ammonia. You might be familiar with it - it practically extracts nitrogen from the air and is used to grow three quarters of the goddamn crops in the world today! Bread from the air. That’s what they called it in the newspapers. Bread from the air. It was seen as a miracle. And so, thanks to Mr. Haber, the world didn’t starve, and we now have nine billion humans. Over half of what we ate in the Twentieth Century was thanks to his discoveries, and when we try to calculate which individual human beings are directly responsible for saving the most human lives, Fritz Haber is at the top of that list. So don’t ever tell me that you can’t change the world by taking time to figure shit out! 

##### [ADAM EXHALES, A PAUSE]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Okay, is it my turn now?  Great. Dr. Blackwell, could you do me a favor? Could you say a bit about Fritz Haber’s work after 1912?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...what?

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Fritz Haber. This man who you clearly think so highly of. 1913 and onwards. What did he get up to?

##### [A PAUSE, ADAM LETS OUT A LOW BREATH]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

He... became involved in World War One. He invented the chlorine gas that the German Army used against the Allies. And he personally oversaw much of its deployment.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Which is why he is often called...?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...the father of chemical warfare. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And after World War One? Any other major contributions to European history? Doctor Blackwell? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...he ...developed a gas. A pesticide gas, which had a warning scent. After his death, it was discovered, and reformulated. So it no longer had that warning scent. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And what was it called? Before and after the reformulation? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...Zyklon A. And Zyklon B. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

I need you to stop doing that. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You need me to stop doing what, answering your questions? 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Losing your temper and going on a three minute screed about the achievements of a German war criminal.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Wait, but - look, he was involved in monstrous things, but that doesn’t- 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Really? We’re doubling down? On the merits of - what was it? - the father of chemical warfare? This is going to be a very hard process, you know. If you’re going to get through it... I need you to be able to not get baited into saying or doing something stupid. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

That - that won’t be a problem. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Won’t it? What happened on August sixteenth, 2028?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well, that’s... Fuck. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Dr. Blackwell? What happened? 

##### [A PAUSE]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I was here in New York. I’d been asked to speak at an event at the U.N. 

##### [TRANSITION SOUND]

#### NARRATOR

New York City. 2028. 

##### [CUSTOMERS MILL AROUND, A FEW OF THEM LAUGH]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Thank you. Keep the change. 

##### [A FEW COINS LAND IN A TIP JAR]

#### AMY STIRLING

Well, well, well... look who actually made it off campus for once. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, good, _you’re_ here. And this had been such a pleasant day so far... 

#### AMY STIRLING

Is that any way to say hello to a dear old friend, Dr. Blackwell? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Hello, Amy. How... inevitable to see you. 

#### AMY STIRLING

That’s more like it. Hello, Adam.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

What are you doing here?

#### AMY STIRLING

Same thing you are. Loading up on caffeine, and then walking over to today’s event. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You’re also speaking at the U.N. 

#### AMY STIRLING

I am. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

And nobody told me. 

#### AMY STIRLING

No. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Which I’m guessing is thanks to - ?

#### AMY STIRLING

It is. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well, thanks for that. I like the hair, by the way. Is that part of the brand now?

#### AMY STIRLING

Something like that. I thought you liked the shaved head look. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well, I had awful taste back when I was still a grad student. So... how  you been? How’s the tour? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Mmm, tour’s is on hold for a bit. I’m doing some events with the campaign. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh yes. I saw your endorsement video. 

#### AMY STIRLING

And I can’t help but notice that I haven’t seen yours. May I ask what the fuck is taking you so long? Don’t tell me you actually want Walker to get re-elected. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I keep telling you, Amy: I’m just a private citizen. I don’t see how it’s my place to tell anyone which way they should vote. 

#### AMY STIRLING

My god, I sometimes forget just how full of shit you are, and then it’s like, “Oh right, he’s totally full of shit.” 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I’m doing well, by the way. The translation work on the materials from the Riemann expedition is- 

#### AMY STIRLING

I really couldn’t give less of a shit, Adam. Now come on, we gonna go do this thing, or what?  

##### [AMY WALKS OUT OF THE COFFEE SHOP, ADAM FOLLOWS HER]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

You know, Amy - you can say that you don’t care all you want, but unfortunately for you? I know you. I know how much you loved this stuff, the translation, the discovery. I know how curious you must be. “What the fuck has he been doing? Cooped up in there all these years? What is he capable of now?” 

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh, it’s so cute, the way you flatter yourself.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, if you think that’s cute... 

##### [A PAUSE, THEY WALK IN SILENCE FOR A BIT...]

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh, all right, Mr. Special. You really want me to believe you’re not just doing coin tricks like some birthday party magician? Let’s see it. No, come on, doctor... you want me to believe you can do something that’s worth my time? Let’s see it. Impress a girl.

##### [SHE LAUGHS IN DISBELIEF]

#### AMY STIRLING

... you made my coffee cup disappear. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yes, I did. 

#### AMY STIRLING

...but ...you didn’t make my coffee go with it. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No, I did not. 

#### AMY STIRLING

...so now... there is quite a bit nitro cold brew... all over my clothes. You are a child. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Come on, Amy. This is an important event. We don’t want to be late.

#### AMY STIRLING

You are still an asshole, Adam Blackwell. Where did you put my coffee cup anyway? 

##### [TRANSITION SOUND]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

How long did it take? Before someone finally found the stupid coffee cup? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Six weeks. Give or take. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Mm-hmm. And it was... this photograph that did it, yes? 

##### [SHE SLIDES A PIECE OF PAPER OVER TO HIM]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Uhh... that’s the one, yeah. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Just for the record could you please verbally describe it? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

It is... a photo taken by the Extremely Large Telescope array. Of the Sea of Tranquility. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

...which is a part of?

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

...the moon. And about five meters to the left of the lunar landing site, there is now a ...coffee cup. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

The moon. You put a cup of coffee on the moon because your ex-girlfriend double dog dared you to.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Ms. Skinner this is all - my relationship with Ms. Stirling is very particular due to - Okay, okay, okay: what you need to understand is that- 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

You say that a lot, you know. What you need to understand is this. What you need to understand is that. You are very worried about how you are seen. I’m gonna help you figure this all out. But I need you to let me help you. Okay? All right. That is all for today. 

##### [SHE STOPS THE TAPE RECORDER]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Really? But- 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

This is plenty for one day. And I have another interview to conduct in a little while. We can pick up this fun tomorrow morning, bright and early. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Right. Well... I’ll see you tomorrow, then. 

##### [HE GETS UP AND STARTS TO WALK TOWARDS THE DOOR]

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Eighteen hundred dollars an hour. That’s how much I’m being paid. To get you across the river. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Okay. Thank you, Miss Skinner. 

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

And... while I will not have you smoking anywhere in my offices, you’ll find I’m less particular about what happens on the balcony on the east side of the building. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Sure. You got it.

#### AMY STIRLING

Those things are gonna kill you, you know... Unless you’re so good now you can just teleport the cancer straight out of your lungs. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I don’t think I’m quite there yet.

#### AMY STIRLING

In that case, you might want to quit while you’re behind. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I’ll take it under advisement. Ms. Stirling. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Dr. Blackwell. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

I thought your residency didn’t end until the fourteenth. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Oh, all the shows are canceled for a bit. You know, it’s hard to compete with the... 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Everything.

#### AMY STIRLING

Yeah. With the everything. I keep... thinking I’m gonna see it. You know? Every time I look up. I know it’s too small and too far away, but... I keep thinking it’ll be there. Staring back at me. 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Yeah, I know. Me too.

#### AMY STIRLING

You doing okay? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Nah. You? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Nah. Not exactly what I had in mind for this year.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

No? 

#### AMY STIRLING

No. I thought there’d be more... books. I thought I’d read more this year. More books and less...

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Everything? You read McCandless’s new book? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Yeah, I got an advance copy. I can’t believe that old fucker’s saying I wasn’t a good student. “Her proposals were never specific enough” my ass. 

##### [ADAM LAUGHS]

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Well, can you blame him? You _are_ the one that got away.

#### AMY STIRLING

Damn right I am. How’d it go in there? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Oh, I pretty much just spent a couple of hours getting bitch-slapped. It was fine. 

#### AMY STIRLING

And? How are you feeling? 

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

Tired. Tired and guilty. 

#### AMY STIRLING

Don’t say that. It isn’t over yet. It’s barely even gotten started.

#### ADAM BLACKWELL

That’s not what I meant, Amy. I think this is usually the point in the conversation where you yell at me and tell me I’m an asshole. 

##### [AMY LAUGHS SOFTLY]

#### AMY STIRLING

You are an asshole, Adam Blackwell. But... for all our sakes, I hope it turns out you’re an asshole who knew what he was doing.

This is Claudia Skinner, case MGR-83-1. This is information/prep session number two. It is November seventh, 2030. Ms. Stirling, would you please state your full name and the capacity in which you have become known as a public figure?

#### AMY STIRLING

This is Amelia Dorothy Stirling, and I perform under the name The Silver Witch. For three years now, I have been able to manifest supernatural abilities. I am the second documented person in the world capable of performing magic.

#### CLAUDIA SKINNER

Thank you. Ms. Stirling, do you know what I would like to talk to about? 

#### AMY STIRLING

Well... if I had to take a guess, I’d say maybe it’s about how I started a chain of events that resulted in the most powerful man in the world teleporting the city of Boston to the moon. I mean, it’s either that or mojito recipes. No, you want to talk about the Boston thing.
